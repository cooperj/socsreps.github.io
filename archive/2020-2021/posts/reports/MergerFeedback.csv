Linking the two subjects and pointing out that CS is used within engineering would help others pick CS as a course as it would perhaps look more relevant,"Yes, definitely. I think CS course material MUST use algorithms / examples that can be demonstrated to tie directly to an engineering purpose. For example maths and vectors and robotics tie directly to servo motors and their control. Examples of big data / machine learning (as we did in our assignments for a power station) should tie in with how the data was obtained (sensors) and how output from machine learning can be used to physical control motors / valves in an engineering sense. Currently we are told that predicting a fault using big data and machine learning can be used in a power station setting but with absolutely no information on how a computer program would interface with the engineering side. Algorithms and programming are great but they stay within a computer - show the interface between computer and the thing it is to control. IoT started to do this but didn't. Perhaps CS course should show how to write device drivers? Perhaps show how a haptic feedback games controller or steering wheel is controlled as a specific example. Perhaps show how a camera and its lens is controlled and the maths relating to the lens are used within Image Processing rather than just presenting an image ready to be processed, perhaps show the complete system of auto-focus from obtaining the image to analysing the sensor data and then using the actuator to change the focus.",School of Computer Science
