    <p>As the school Rep I have the opportunity to attend several panels. A panel in this context is a dedicated team of lecturers, administrators, school leaders and students who meet to provide feedback for the current course. As well as to hear about the latest developments in the program or any professional body work being carried out. An example this year is the hard work completed by <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/24c4fa4e-e572-4f3d-a77a-fa5631ca951a" target="_blank">Dr Kevin Jaques</a> and team to ensure that the examination and assessments for the Computer Science and respective degrees follow required accreditation specifications (think around Time Constrained Assessments etc). These of course were all really well considered and the examining bodies made specific reference to how well the school had prepared in this regard.</p>

    <p>At this panel meeting there were around 45 participants form across the College of Science. This includes the school of Engineering, School of Geography, Life Sciences to name a few. This is a quarterly meeting and so we will only have the opportunity to attend 4 times across the year. To ensure that the time is well used all the reps have a prep meeting with the SU VP of Eduction, Georgia Petts. Georgia kindly took us all through the general process and made it clear how the meetings worked. The meeting is very structured due to the senior leaders that take part. There are formal minutes and papers that are required to be read and approved before hand. A minute taker is present and agenda items are agreed in advance. Any item that a participant would like to go on the agenda is requested in advance. This all seems quite complicated however there are lots of emails helping you along the way before hand! </p> 

    <p>Once in the meeting it is very structured but in an informal way. Everyone is made to feel at ease. Each student rep has a chance to report on their schools and highlight any concerns or present any wins they have had. In the main at this stage, there are no new items discussed and everything spoken about should already be known within the school. However, this is a really positive opportunity to represent your school and show other schools what is going on. A bit of bragging rights! </p> 

    <p>This session we had the opportunity to break out int small groups and discuss diversity across the college. This is the main campaign theme for the College of Science this academic year so is an important topic to ensure gets full visibility. During the break out sessions teams made note of all areas that are under represented, how that can be improved, what can we do in the future and what are things we can do straight away. It was an excellent session and provided lots if ideas.</p> 

    <p>Overall, the Panel meeting was very positive. Discussion was open and frank, students were invited to contribute throughout and their voices taken seriously. I look forward to attending the other panels meeting when we are further into the year and discussing more important student topics.</p>
