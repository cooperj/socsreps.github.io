    <p>Module Evaluations are a critical part of the year for all students as they allow anyone to have a full say over what they felt their modules have been like, how they have been delivered and how they felt assessments, assignments or any other aspect of the module has been. Module evaluations are an internal tool run by the <a href="https://lalt.lincoln.ac.uk/aboutlalt/">Lincoln Academy of Learning and Teaching</a>. A key aspect of these evaluations is that they go to inform the teaching bodies at the university on how each area of a module can be improved.</p>  

    <p>During crisis such as Covid and the move to online learning it is absolutely key to try and feedback your experiences so that your following year can be catered and improved to each students experience. It doesn't matter if you have 10 positive points or 10 negative points, every thought helps inform future changes. It may be that you thought the assignments were too long and needed to be split down further, it maybe that you thought that the online lectures were dull or could be more engaging, or it maybe that you thought there was some really great practice taking place and you want to see this done more across your other modules. Every opinion helps! Remember, lecturers and the people making these decisions have not been in your shoes for perhaps several years; you are living and breathing these experiences, so share them!</p>

    <h3>Where can I find the module evaluation forms?</h3>

    <p>The Module Evaluations forms can be found on each modules relevant Blackboard page. They link is on the bottom of the Left hand Side black vertical banner. See image below for an example:</p>
