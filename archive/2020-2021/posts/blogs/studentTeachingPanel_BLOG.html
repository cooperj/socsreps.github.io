  <h5 style="color:grey">October 24, 2020</h5> 

    <p>A great way to have a long term impact on the way that the SoCS delivers its teaching agenda is by taking part in the actual interview process of prospective lecturers. This is done by participating in the Teaching Panel Interview . The panel is one of a set of panels that a prospective candidate will participate in (such as a Research Panel Interviews etc) with the aim to find out as much about the potential candidate as possible. The key difference with the Teaching Panel Interview is that <b>students</b> are invited to participate! All panel members have an equal say and all views are equally heard.</p>

    <p>I was fortunate to be invited to a recent Teaching Interview Panel along with my Course Rep peers, and this post is a high level overview of what was involved and the general arrangement of the activities. The aim of this post is help students who would like to take part in this process, but are just not sure of what the process entails to feel comfortable participating in the future.</p>

    <p>The structure of the day was as you would imagine. Preset times for each candidate were arranged and several panel members invited to attend. In this series of interviews the panel members were made up of experienced lecturers and researchers from across the SoCS as well as its research groups. Interviews we staged at 1 hour intervals with 30 minutes presentation and discussion followed by a 15 minute panel discussion and general assessment. This feedback is then collated and presented to the Head of School.</p>

    <p>Due to Covid-19 restrictions the interviews were conducted via Microsoft Teams. Although this is not ideal, this still provided a good mechanism to get an insight into each candidate and allowed for a more diverse set of candidates due to travel minimization. It also supported a wider set of panelists to participate in the process through the day to support the discussion and general assessment process. </p>

    <p>Each panel has a panel lead and the Teaching Interview Panel was led by <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/d5823cb6-8053-4f12-9627-24fed0074489">Dr Khaled Bachour</a>. The panel lead makes sure the candidate is properly introduced and has a clear agenda of the session as well as help manage time and questions. The panel lead also has the responsibility of arranging suitable panelists and making sure the time tabling for candidates is full and proper as well as communicating this out to the students and staff taking part in the panel. The process in this instance was very well led and went without any disruption or overlap.</p>

    <p>Each panelist was requested to attend 10 minutes early to ensure that suitable questions were prepared and that a broad range of panelists were available.  Once the candidate arrived within the Teams call, the panel lead made suitable introductions and requested all panelists to introduce themselves and their role. Once all the staff had introduced themselves the students were asked to do the same. I found this very helpful as I know my peers also did as it made it clear that students were part of the process.</p>

    <p>The aim of the Teaching Panel is to gauge the candidates ability and style of teaching, presenting and overall engagement techniques. The candidate is provided with a topic prior to the panel interview and are asked to prepare a 15 minute presentation targeted towards 1st year students. The candidate then has to present this in a lecture style with the expectancy of questions similar to that what 1st year students would ask. Candidates are allowed to present this material in whatever way they see fit using whatever technology they feel would be useful.</p>

    <p>The presentation time provided was 15 minutes. This allowed a 15 minute question and answer session. This question and answer session come in two parts:

    <ol>
      <li>Questions on the lecture material itself </li>
      <li>Questions on the candidates pedagogy style</li>
    </ol> 

    The lecture material questions consisted of the panel challenging the candidate on the material they prepared and presented. The aim here wasn't to identify their depth of knowledge (although that was important too), but to see how they helped a student discover more details on the subject at hand. A question from a 1st year in some instances is not complete and so identifying how the candidate contextualized these questions was important.</p>

    <p>The questions on the pedagogy style were different. They tackled concepts of teaching in small groups and large groups, changing teaching styles from face to face to on line learning, managing workshops and linking materials, and how to fully engage students and what techniques they would employ to do that.</p>

   <p>Students were given just as much time as other panelist to ask questions of the candidates and were very much seen as an equal contributer.  Once these question session had ended the candidate was thanked  for their time and preparation, asked if they had any further questions and wished luck for the following panels. The panel were then permitted to have a general discussion about the candidate with the panel lead taking notes.</p>

   <p>The general discussion focused on 3 parts:

    <ol>
      <li>How effectively did the candidate communicate </li>
      <li>Was the lecture content appropriate and complete w.r.t the subject and target audience</li>
      <li>How did the candidate respond to questions</li>
    </ol> 

    The panel lead initiated the discussion and then allowed entry by all panelists. What was very evident was that students were again given a full remit to discuss their thoughts and were seen as equal panelists. The discussion in general was extremely insightful and hearing the staff comments really helped the students engage in the overall conversation. 
   </p>

    <p>Once the discussion had come to a natural end, a general summary was provided and the panel then broke away and reconvened for the following candidate. Each interview took circa 45 minutes in total and was very worthwhile attending. One of the key takeaways I had was how great our lecturers actually are and how thoughtful they were when it come to what new team members would provide to the student population as a whole. The student experience was very much at the center of the interview.</p>

    <p>I hope the above has helped anyone interested in taking part in a Teaching Panel Interview feel more comfortable with the process. It is very worthwhile attending and supporting these panels and as a student it provides a very real way to be part of positively impacting the student teaching experience.</p>
