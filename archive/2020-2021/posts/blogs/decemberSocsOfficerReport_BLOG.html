  <h5 style="color:grey">December 16, 2020</h5> 

  <p>December has been an odd month! It seems like not only a few weeks ago we were just starting this period of the Semester. In that time please be assured the reps and I have been at your full attention and raising issues where you have shown them and also posing ideas where you have presented them. The general day to day wins as well as the wider aspects of things we do are submitted in an officers report by me (SoCS School Rep). This month the reporting period was a little shorter so not as much has occurred and the reporting date was brought forward to the 16th December from the 23rd December. These reports are all freely available and can be found at <a href="https://www.lincolnsu.com/officer-reports">www.lincolnsu.com/officer-reports</a>.</p>

  <p>We have some great initiatives that we plan to kick off as we head past the halfway mark of the academic year. This is around improving our visibility to help as many fellow students as possible, and also around inclusivity, with women in science round tables helping guide the conversation on this important topic. We hope that you can join in with us on that journey. In the meantime, we (all the reps), wish everyone a very happy winter holidays and a great start to the 2021 year! </p>

  <p>For added transparency I will also publish the submitted reports each month as a post, this is linked <a href="../reports/December2020_SoCS_Officer_Report.pdf">here</a> as well as shown below. We would love to hear any <a href="../../feedback.html">Feedback</a> and remember no concern or idea is too small. </p>
