  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">October 8, 2020</h5> 

    <p>One of the opportunities the School Rep has at the very beginning of the new Autumn term or Semester A, is to address the new student intake during the <a href="https://onlineorientation.lincoln.ac.uk" target="_blank">orientation week activities</a>. This is a real pleasure because it not only gives a chance for the new students to meet another student but also provides an opportunity to share the great set of course reps that they will have as a support tool all though their University career. </p>

  <img src="../assets/OrientationWeekPresentation_IMAGE2.png" class="image" alt="test" style="width:100%"></img>

   <p>It was my pleasure this year to give this talk and I wanted to make sure that you have access to this in the future. Please find linked a <a href="../assets/SchoolRepSocialIntro.pdf">pdf version of the presentation</a> as well as the full <a href="../assets/OrientationWeekSchoolRepIntroductionPresentationScript.pdf">transcript</a>.</p>

   <p>These talks are not easy to prepare for as you never know what questions you may get, however, what is easy to do is to ensure that all the hard work, that as the School Rep you get to witness, that has taken place over the summer period is recognized. The SoCS team, lecturers, admin team and all associated staff, worked extremely hard over the last 6 months to make sure that all students have the best experience yet when coming back to University for this academic year.</p>

    <p>Although this is a different type of start to the school year, the one thing that will be consistent is the great quality of students that the University of Lincoln and particularly, the School of Computer Science has in its cohort. I want to wish every one the very best and also to let you know there is a significant support network available if you find that something is in your way to achieving your best</p>

    <p>These invited events provide a large platform and I encourage every single SoCS student to get engaged and to make sure you put your reps to good use in these meetings. If you are not having the experience you want then please reach out and let us know. You can contact any one of us through our <b><a href="../../index.html#about">email links</a></b> or anonymously using our <b><a href="../../feedback.html">Feedback page</a></b>. All emails are received in the strictest of confidence. No concern or idea is too small.  </p>
