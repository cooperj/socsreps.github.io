  <p><i>We normally send these monthly newsletters out via the University email with the permission of the School, however going forwards we have also decided to share this on our blog. We hope you enjoy!</i></p>

  <p>Welcome back to the final term of Semester B. I really hope that you each had a restful Easter break and are ready to push for these final few weeks! This time of year is always really busy with completion of group projects and finishing touches to dissertations as well as making 3rd year optional module selections. This can all be daunting so please don&apos;t be afraid to reach out to your course reps who are happy to help and share their experiences.</p>

  <p>As a courtesy reminder your course reps are:</p>

  <p>To keep up to date with how the course reps are representing you please check out our blogs <a href="https://socsreps.github.io/blog.html">https://socsreps.github.io/blog.html</a>, but also feel free to just drop us a line. We are here to represent you and to make sure everyone is having their best experience. No idea or concern is too small. </p>

  <p>There are 3 key items to share with you today:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>New SoCS School rep for 21/22 Academic year!</li>
    <li>National Student Survey &ndash; Final Year students</li>
    <li>Proposed merger of SoCS with School of Engineering</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b><u>New SoCS School Rep for 20/21 Academic Year:</u></b><br>
  Congratulation to William Oldham for be voted into the role of SoCS School Rep for next academic year! William I know has been a positive voice across year 1 and 2 as well as being the President of BSL Society, which has gone from strength to strength. William has already started sharing ideas and working with the current rep team which has been awesome. Please help me in congratulating William to the SoCS School rep role! </p>


  <p><b><u>National Student Survey:</u></b><br>
  Final year undergraduate students have until the 30th April to complete the national student survey: <a href="https://www.thestudentsurvey.com">https://www.thestudentsurvey.com</a>. It is getting closer to the deadline so some of you who have not yet completed may be getting calls from the survey operator (Ipsos MORI)! The more students that share their experiences from the last 3 years means that new and upcoming students get the best view of the School as possible. Please remember back on how important this information was for you when deciding on University and give a helping hand to them as you pass the baton to the next year of students. </p>

  <p><b><u>Proposed merger of SoCS and School of Engineering:</u></b><br>
  There is a proposed merger between the SoCS and the School of Engineering. <b>This is an important and significant topic for students to engage in and be heard on. Almost no details of this proposal have been shared or presented to students.</b> This proposal was not publicised and the initial discovery of this proposal can be found here: <a href="https://socsreps.github.io/posts/blogs/importantInformation_BLOG.html">https://socsreps.github.io/posts/blogs/importantInformation_BLOG.html</a>. Now that it is in the public domain, there is a responsibility of the College of Science (CoS) and SoCS leadership team to engage those that it impacts. I ask you all to make your voice heard to ensure you are part of this conversation.</p>

  <p>The CoS and SoCS prides itself on how well it communicates, but there is a difference between communicating required information (health and safety, course details etc) and sharing community information. If information that impacts the community (now or in 5 years time) is not shared or seen by everyone in that community then that speaks of the community itself. SoCS is a fantastic place with its own identity and significant set of alumni, and current and future students. We are each custodians of this community for those that follow us. When we go for new jobs in 20 years time we will be still be referencing the University and school and hoping that it has continued to improve, so we each have a direct interest in its continued wellbeing.</p>

  <p>It is up to each of us to make sure that we are actually ‘one community’ and that the leadership are held accountable for any future changes and to ensure that students have a direct voice in these potential changes <b>before</b> they are agreed. I will keep pushing this topic over the next weeks and will keep you informed on how well information is being provided as well as its content.</p>

  <p><b>Finally &hellip;</b> For those in their final year but perhaps have not decided on what you wish to do after your academic studies have finished, no fear, support is here! This can be a difficult and uncertain period so please reach out and contact the fantastic University of Lincoln careers team <a href="https://uolcareers.co.uk">https://uolcareers.co.uk</a> or have a chat with your PT about what further studies may be like. Sometimes having so many options can be daunting but there is lots if support available, so please don’t be afraid to use that. It is exactly what they are there for.</p> 

  <p><b>In closing &hellip;</b> As your school and course rep team we are here to ensure that your student voice is being heard, and to support the school in ensuring that your experience is as broad and as engaging as possible. No idea or concern is too small. Please make sure you continue to seek us out and let us know your thoughts. We can all be contacted directly or anonymously via our website: <a href="https://socsreps.github.io">https://socsreps.github.io</a>.</p> 

  <p>The reps and I wish you a fantastic final term of Semester B and all the success that your hard work has created over this last academic year.</p>

  <p>Garry</p>

  <p>SoCS School Rep 20/21</p>
