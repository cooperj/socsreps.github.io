  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">November 16, 2020</h5> 

    <p>Cleaning down your equipment before and after use is one of the top ways to ensure that you and your fellow students and staff stay safe and protected from Covid-19. <b><mark>This task can to all to easily missed but I ask you all to keep vigilant and ensure that you always clean your equipment throughly before and after use.<mark></b></p> 

    <p>The school has a well defined set of procedures and guidelines called   <a href="https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/media/responsive2017/abouttheuniversity/governance/universitypolicies/Safe,Campus,Guidance,Document.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Keeping Everyone Safe on Campus</b></a> and I urge you to have a read through. It goes into lots of details about what to expect while on campus, but also what is expected of you as a student when you are here.</p>

    <p>I know that some of you may not yet have attended a F2F workshop and so don;t yet know what the labs now look like. I have provided below a brief overview of all the new things you will see when you enter a lab. <b>Please ensure you use all of these safety precautions!</b> Hopefully, for those that may not yet have been to a F2F workshop, this will give you confidence that the school is as Covid safe as possible, but also help you navigate the process as a whole.</p> 

    <p><mark>Remember! It is really important that you wipe down your equipment and work space before and after every use.<mark></p> 

    <h4>What to Expect When Going To a Lab:</h4>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/cleandownComputers_IMAGE2.png" alt="Snow" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>1.</b> Lots of floor guides showing where you can go. Remember that the main INB entrance is now not an exit! All exist are at the rear of the INB. Stick to these!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/cleandownComputers_IMAGE3.png" alt="Forest" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>2.</b> Lost of wall mounted signs showing the right entrance's and exit's to use. These are everywhere but sometimes they are easy to miss. Keep an eye out for them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/cleandownComputers_IMAGE7.png" alt="Forest" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>3.</b> Clear hand cleaning stations situated at either the entrance or exit of the room/lab. The wipes are great as they are already sanitized and wet ready for wiping down your equipment - so no spray is needed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/cleandownComputers_IMAGE5.png" alt="Forest" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>4.</b> Clear markings showing what computers you can safely sit at. This helps keep a safe distance between others but doesn't hinder discussions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/cleandownComputers_IMAGE6.png" alt="Snow" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>5.</b> Clear perspex barriers between you and the opposite computer. They are pretty handy and don't get in the way.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="../assets/cleandownComputers_IMAGE4.png" alt="Snow" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>6.</b> One way systems into and out of Labs and rooms. Your key cards will still work on either so please read the signs. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Once you attend a F2F workshop and get familiar with the situation it becomes second nature to remember to do all of the cleaning actions. Sticking to these requirements is really important and being pro-active about it really helps the lecturers ensure that you are in a safe space and the environment around you is as clean as possible. PLease support them as they do this difficult task!</p>
