  <h5 style="color:grey">February 20, 2021</h5> 

  <p>A really useful monthly committee meeting that the SoCS School Rep has the privilege to attend is the CoS Education and Students Committee. This committee is dedicated to making the education and operational processes within the College of Science as as accessible and transparent as possible for all students. The Chair of the committee is the College Director of Education and Students, <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/f59d7617-69ae-4fca-a926-6c82600cff9b">Dr Andy Evenden</a>. </p> 

  <p>The purpose of the committee is to develop and improve the educational facilities and operations with respect to student experience. This is in the formal sense and also informal sense. This targets elements such as student wellbeing, new programs being developed and support services taking place. It is also a key place where school reps can share feedback gathered through the local school committees as well as directly from course reps. This meeting as well as the <a href="https://socsreps.github.io/posts/blogs/subjectCommitteeMeeting_BLOG.html">SoCS UG Subject Committee</a> all feedback into the main <a href="https://socsreps.github.io/posts/blogs/CoSAcademicBoardMeeting_BLOG.html">CoS Academic Board Meeting</a>.</p>

  <p>The meeting has a general agenda similar to the Academic board, but key parts are made up with review papers. Review papers are meant to be read prior to the meeting and should help get everyone on the same page regarding key actions/proposals. Additionally, during this meeting several student points are discussed but particular focus is placed in breakout groups. These breakout groups are sessions where students can really get into giving feedback on key areas around the college. This months breakout group was to discuss a 'Summer Festival of Skills'. This is a proposed month long activity that will support students with getting additional opportunities for development on sport, health and wellbeing as well as academic items. But a key driver is just to try and bring a bit of social interaction back into the College as the Covid pandemic potentially begins to end. This is something that has been sorely missed by students and staff alike.</p>

  <p>Key points raised during this breakout session was the date of the festival and equality of opportunity for all to attend. What sort of activities that would be on offer and not trying to do 'more' academic stuff but more fun stuff that will allow new and old students to have fun and see one another in an informal setting. Overall, the discussion was very positive and the chair took several responses away to incorporate into the festival.</p>

  <p>Sometimes these meetings are difficult to make sense of for students not part of the review process, so I have placed the review paper of the 'Summer Festival of Skills' below. This should hopefully give some sense of what a review paper looks like, how it is used and how it aids discussion within a breakout group. But more so, hopefully it shows the types of background work and thought that the college goes to, to try and bring the best student experience to the school. I know from attending several of these meetings now that the key focus is that students get the very best outcome and experience and it is always a central focus for every meeting.</p>
