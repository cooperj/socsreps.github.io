  <h5 style="color:grey">May 24, 2021</h5> 

  <p>As the government continues to open up vaccination bookings to younger age groups, you may have wondered what the whole process is like. If you are planning on getting your vaccination in Lincoln, then it will most likely take place at the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/hospital-hubs-and-local-vaccination-services/" target="_blank">Lincolnshire Showground</a>. Many students may never have been to the showground, so to help minimize any worry we have put together a step by step guide of what to expect when getting your Covid vaccination!</p>

 
    <h4>What to Expect!</h4>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE2.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>1. Location:</b> The showground is about 5 miles from the University of Lincoln campus. It will take about 1 hour to walk at a nice pace (if you fancy that), or &pound;8.40 in a taxi. Alternatively, you can catch the <a href="https://lincolnbus.co.uk/journey-tools/timetables" target="_blank">103</a> bus which goes right by. Just a note on the walk, it is a busy road and the path can get narrow (single file and minimal bank to road) in places.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE3.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>2. Accessing the showground:</b> When you get to the entrance of the show ground (Gate 1), there are attendants who will help guide drivers if they are unsure of where to go. To get to the actual vaccination center, it takes about 1-2 minutes more once past the gates as there is a 10mph speed limit and chicane style curves on the infield roads.</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="row">
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE4.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>3. Entrance:</b> Once at the centre drop off point you will be greeted at the door and asked your age and if you have your booking number. Be sure to bring that! You will also be asked questions if you have had or have been in contact with anyone who has had Covid. If you have forgotten your mask, you can get one here!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE5.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>4.Queuing:</b> Once you get past the front door, you will enter into a large hall that is split into 3 sections. It is all very well marked out. The first section is the queuing area to register. The second area is the interview area, and the third and final stage is where you will have your jab. Its all open plan and at each section there is lots of people so you you will always know what is going on!</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE6.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>5. Registration Desk: </b> Once you clear the queue (about 20 mins). You will be at the registration desk. This is where they confirm your details and also take your booking reference. This can be found on your booking email. Make sure you have it handy! Here you will get two documents with useful information on and your vaccination card (credit card size). 
      </div>
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE7.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>6. Vaccination Record Card:</b> Once you have cleared the registration desk. You will now have your vaccination information and your vaccination record card in hand. The vaccination record card is only cardboard so keep it dry and safe! Your vaccination record card has your name, vaccination provider and which jab it is (1st or 2nd) and you will need it for your 2nd jab.</p></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE8.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>7. 2nd Section:</b> You will now queue to enter the 2nd section. The queue is about 2 people deep so waiting takes only 1 to 2 minutes max, and is dependent when an interview table becomes free. This is the pre-jab interview area. Here, you will be asked about your health, anything anyone should be aware of (medication etc), and also to confirm your details again. As you can see, everything is constantly being cleaned! There is lots of space and it is easier to move around for wheelchair users and walking aids.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE9.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>8. Waiting for the Jab:</b> Once you have gone through all your information with the nursing team, you will then be asked to wait in a small seating area of about 12 chairs. This is the waiting area for the jab, which is the 3rd and final section. To get to this stage it has taken about 25 minutes (depending on size of queue at the very start). There are three entrances from this waiting area to the 3rd section, and they each have closed in screens. Behind these screens is a semi-open plan area with a joint exit to the right of the hall. But because of the way the chairs and desks are arranged, you cannot see anyone else receiving their jab. So it is very private. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE10.gif" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>9.Getting the Jab!:</b> I couldn't take pictures here but, if you don't like needles, I can honestly say I hardly felt a thing. The nurses were fantastic and very friendly. It took about 2 minutes in total, mainly due to confirming my details again. The jab itself took only 3 seconds. Key: Remember to wear a short sleeve shirt. The jab is at the very top of your arm (side delt area). I didn't and had to strip! But, once done, I was given my documents back and a cool sticker to show I had the vaccine. I was then asked to leave through the large exit on the right. This exit is at the rear of the building, so to get back to your car or transport you will need to walk around to the entrance again (about 2 mins walk around the building). </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column2">
        <img src="../assets/covid_IMAGE11.png" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>10. Top Tip:</b> If booking a taxi, don't make a rookie error like I did. I had my jab at 14:00 and so needed a taxi at around 14:45. I found out that this was very busy time, especially on a Friday and I couldn't get one until 17:00! With that, it was quicker to walk. Two positive notes, I got to go past the fantastic Riseholme Campus, and it also didn't rain! I also bought myself an ice-cream on the walk, which was nice.</p>
      </div>

  <p>We hope you found this step by step guide to what to expect from having your vaccination jab useful. It can seem a daunting process but in the end it took about 45 minutes and was very easy. It was very well organized with lots of space and lots of people to ask for help. There are toilet facilities and seats if anyone needs them for any reason. There is also lots of consideration for users of wheelchairs and walking aids, as well as those that may need companion support. </p>

  <p>So, when your age bracket is allowed, please don't delay and get your vaccine!</p>
