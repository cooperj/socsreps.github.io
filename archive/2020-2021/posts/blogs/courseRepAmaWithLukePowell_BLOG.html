  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">June 21, 2020</h5> 

    <p>Luke was a 3rd year Course Rep in 19/20 and today kindly donated his time and experience to have have an Ask Me Anything (AMA) discussion with the new SoCS course reps. Luke was extremely insightful and offered lots of ideas and suggestions about to how make yourself visible to as many students as possible, as well as offering ideas on how to best deal with student concerns or problems.</p> 

  <p>Luke also offered insights into the day to day role of being a course rep as well as what meetings reps attended and what they were like. Luke made many recommendations during the discussion but a few stood out as being the most important. These were:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Don't be afraid to stand up and let people know who you are. A key part of the course reps role is making yourself visible to you peer group. 99% of the time people are happy that you have made yourself known to them and feel more comfortable coming to you with any issues after that.</li>
    <li>Be confident, there will be times where you have to send a certain email or speak to a certain lecturer; this may make your nervous. However, they all all here to help and make sure that everyone is having the best experience possible. </li>
    <li>Build relationships, a large part of the role is developing trust. Taking the time to connect with people across the course can really build a broad perspective and gives you the best chance of helping the most people. </li>
  </ol> 

  <p>There were many more lessons that Luke helped us with an overall it was a very worthwhile session that could have gone on for another hour at least. We hope to arrange another AMA nearer October as we get the new starts coming into the school and with the lessons Luke has taught us we know we are in a better position to help them as they start on the university journey. Thanks again Luke for a great session, we all learned a lot!</p>

  <p>If anyone reading is interested in becoming a course rep then please send us an <a href="../../index.html#about">email</a> or contact us through our <a href="../../feedback.html">Feedback</a> page. We would love to hear from you!</p>
