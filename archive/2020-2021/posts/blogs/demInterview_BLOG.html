    <p>Many of you will have heard of and hopefully used the Demonstrator Help Desk on Teams. This is one of those amazing resources that once you use, you always go to. But, who are the people that run this wonderful resource? Well, we thought we would find out and got together with two of our best demonstrators, <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/71bc32cb-f406-4683-a9af-7122c65c9998" target="_blank">Ben Williams</a> and <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/fade5498-4ef1-4fc4-9fc3-18c721416722" target="_blank">Wayne Andrews</a> for a Q&amp;A session.</p>

    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> Ben, Wayne. Welcome, and thanks for taking the time today to take part in our Q&amp;A session. First, tell us what a day in the life of a demonstrator is like?</b></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Ben]</mark></b><i> I give assistance to students between 13:00 and 15:00 on Fridays. I normally work as an RA here in the school, so demonstrating is a nice change of scenery for me on a Friday. Usually the process I take when demonstrating is to turn on the coffee machine, read papers on one screen, and monitor the help desk on the other. Whenever a question comes in, I either redirect them to the most appropriate person to help, or help them the best I can. Typically, most problems are pretty straight-forward and easy to fix, but sometimes they require a 1-on-1 call where we can resolve the matter together. I also retrospectively search for issues which have are still open and unresolved, and try my best to help where possible. I think everyone has a particular style of demonstrating, but this is mine!</i></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Wayne]</mark></b><i> I currently occupy the Thursday 9-11am slot. I tend to start around 8:30am.</i></p>
  
    <p><i>All of the demonstrators have designated times allocated, these are typically a 2hr slot. I tend to like to spend 30mins before my slot going through each of the module channels to see if there are any questions or issues that may have been missed. I reach out to issues that I see are still outstanding and I contact the demonstrators that dealt with the issue to either update the thread or to get a handle on what the situation is currently.</i></p>
  
    <p><i>After my 2hr slot (generally tends to be around 3hrs, as when I am in a call with a student I am not going to leave them until the issue is resolved or the student has enough information and understanding to come to a resolution themselves.) I will update the demonstrators only channel of any issues that may persist and make other demonstrators aware of any deadlines that may be looming so they know to be ready to field questions in that area.</i></p>


    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> Roughly, how many demonstrators are there?</b></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Ben]</mark></b><i> Our numbers vary from semester to semester. Currently there are roughly 19 of us.</i></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Wayne]</mark></b><i> I&apos;m unsure on exact numbers, but a rough guess would be around 20ish.</i></p>



    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> Sometimes you get questions just at the end of your shift. Do you prefer to keep questions that you answer or pass them to the next person?</b></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Ben]</mark></b><i> For me, it depends on the particular subject. If I have experience in that area, and it&apos;s a fairly niche subject (e.g. Physics Simulation), then I like to spend a few minutes helping them out if I can. If I have another meeting to go to, I like to direct them towards an online resource which they can go through to help resolve the issue, or point them towards the most appropriate person to help. If however, the subject is something which could be resolved by others, I pass it onto the next demonstrator on shift. This way the student gets the help they need fast.</i></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Wayne]</mark></b><i> It often happens that you will get a question within the last 15mins of your time slot, I will always try to ensure I get a response to the student first, even if it is just to inform them of the next demonstrator, but most of the time I will stick about and answer the question if it&apos;s something I can help with or I make sure the next demonstrator is aware of the question and has responded.</i></p>

    <p><i>To do anything else, in my opinion is not fair to the student, as students tend to only ask a question as a last resort after exhausting most other avenues. So they expect a prompt reply and during the 9-5 Tuesday to Friday and 11-5 on a Monday that&apos;s exactly what they should get.</i></p>


    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> Some may think you are all huddled in some dark room around a single computer. Is this true?</b></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Ben]</mark></b><i> I work from home, and as far as I&apos;m aware, the majority of others do too. There may be a few demonstrators who work virtually from the campus, but I&apos;m unsure on that. I do miss the days of demonstrating in person though, hopefully we&apos;ll be there again soon in the near future!</i></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Wayne]</mark></b><i> Some of us are aliens &#8230; Nah just kidding, that&apos;s just me &#8230; </i></p>

    <p><i>We are mostly remote, some of us are located within the University campus, but the system has been set up in such a way that it allows us to work from where we are more comfortable and ensures we adhere to the current Covid guidelines.</i></p>

    <p><i>When workshop sessions return to <q>normal</q> you will find us present in your timetabled sessions on hand to aid you whilst you work through your tasks.</i></p>



    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> What&apos;s been the strangest question you have had so far?</b></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Ben]</mark></b><i> Unfortunately we don&apos;t get a lot of strange questions, the majority are fairly standard questions you might expect about a particular module. The majority (in my experience) relate to problems with code, or how to best go about implementing a feature in their solution. This is closely followed by questions which ask for clarification about a particular concept or the workshop material itself. If I had to offer up the strangest question I&apos;ve had, I&apos;d probably go with one from last year &hyphen; a student asked the best strategy for making their <q>space worm wiggle</q> like a real worm does, as part of their Procedural Content Generation assignment!</i></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Wayne]</mark></b><i> There isn&apos;t really a stand out question to be honest. I remember what it was like being an undergrad and when something doesn&apos;t click, then sometimes you just need to have it explained a different way.</i></p>

    <p><i>My motto is, <q>there is no such thing as a silly question</q>, you either know the answer and therefore don&apos;t need to ask, or you genuinely don&apos;t and I prefer it that you ask instead of suffer in silence.</i></p>



    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> Have you ever thought, &lsquo;oh no, not that student again!&rsquo;?</b></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Ben]</mark></b><i> Never! I always love helping people out, whether it&apos;s a difficult question or an easy one. Some students require more help than others, and I always welcome further questions. I see it as an opportunity to build a bond with that person, and add a personal touch to it. I don&apos;t want to be known just as the person assigned to help, but rather as a colleague willing to assist where possible. It&apos;s the little things like this that make the UoL SoCS community what it is, and I love being a part of it.</i></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Wayne]</mark></b><i> Not quite, <q>oh, no</q>, but there will always be some modules that are quite a challenge, so you will find that you have a number of students all with the same question, but too afraid to ask publicly, so we tend to have to answer the same thing over and over.</i></p>

    <p><i>So it&apos;s more a case of, <q>oh no, not that question again!</q></i></p>


    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> Do the demonstrators have an interesting inside jokes about students that we should know of?</b></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Ben]</mark></b><i> I don&apos;t think we do! Or at least if we do, I&apos;ve been left out!</i></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Wayne]</mark></b><i> Not got any inside jokes about students in person, just as a group in general. As I mentioned earlier the times that we are allowed to monitor the boards. But you can guarantee that someone will be asking questions in the middle of the night when there are no demonstrators around.</i></p>

    <p><i>This is how some questions get missed, and which is why I prefer to scan through each module and check for those midnight oil burners.</i></p>



    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> What&apos;s your proudest moment been as a demonstrator this year?</b></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Ben]</mark></b><i> I had a student message me in dire straits with one of their assignments when I was on shift. The student was certain they were going to fail. I spent most of the time in that session helping them out, answering any questions they had, and pointed them towards the right place. They just needed to run through the workshops, and I only assisted with some concepts they couldn&apos;t wrap their head around. I answered some small queries they had via email before the next Friday, and we had another chat when I was on shift again. They ended up passing the assignment and I was so proud of them! I am also proud of the effort as a whole we provide as demonstrators. It warms the cockles of my heart when I see a thread of 3&hyphen;4 demonstrators all working to solve one issue for a student.</i></p>

    <p><b><mark>[Wayne]</mark></b><i> I currently have a dedicated drop in session for a group of MSc Students which is rewarding as I was part of that cohort myself previously and actually won the MSc student of the year award, so I try to make sure I get the students thinking proactively and ensure that they don&apos;t have any issues that could impede their academic journey.</i></p>


    <p><b><mark>[Garry]</mark> Ben, Wayne. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. It has been awesome getting to know a bit about your role as Demonstrators. As a student myself who has called on you many times over the last 3 years, I want to thank you for all the effort that you, and the other demonstrators put in. It is really appreciated and makes a tangible difference to the performance and confidence of every student that asks for help.</b></p>
