  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">October 1, 2020</h5> 
    <p>
      It is at this time of year (a few weeks prior to timetables going live) that the School and Course Reps support the process of ensuring that assignment and tests are as evenly balanced through the Semesters as possible. Although the key major work is done upfront by the Module Leads themselves, there is always a conversation with Reps to get as much student perspective as possible.
    </p> 

    <p>
      The discussion is not a negotiation (i.e. course reps can't negotiate that a assignment is removed or becomes a test), but it is a positive two way review about possible options and the best way to achieve balance as well as to take in any lessons that may have been learned from the previous years. Especially as this year is the 2nd year of a new cohort of modules. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The process is quite simple and the assignment sheet overall looks very similar to your assignment due date spreadsheet. <i>I an unable to share this assignment timetable sheet but as is not confirmed until it is fully released</i>. The review process breakdown is below:

      <ol>
        <li>Draft assignment timetable put together</li>
        <li>High level review by Director of Teaching and Learning (Chris Headleand)</li>
        <li>Feedback provided and worked up at Module lead level</li>
        <li>Chris arranges review with the reps to have initial discussion</li>
        <li>Reps receive a version of the timetable and can make amendments</li>
        <li>Proposed amendments are discussed and clarified</li>
        <li>Chris reviews amendments with impacted module Leaders</li>
        <li>Updates are implemented or not implemented</li>
      </ol> 

    </p>

    <p>
      The process takes a few weeks but once you get to step 4 it can perhaps be just a few days. This year I sat down with Chris and I made 8 amendments proposals. In general Year 1 looked good. This year specifically we have the benefit of enhancement weeks which allows for a 14 week Semester A. This provides a little buffer but also, due to the Semester starting 1 month late, we miss a large impact on Christmas. However, that impact is just offset until February. Year 2 also looked good but a few changes towards the back end of Semester B were requested due to some clumping. There was also some slight changes to the way modules were being assessed which was different to my experience in Year 2 last year (AI for instance won't have demonstrator assessed tasks) so these were also discussed. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The key changes were made in year 3. This was mainly due to year 3 being able to choose optional modules. This meant that several optional assignments clashed with Core module assignments. This would impact some but not all of the students. We saw that there was 2 core module assignments due in the same week and then the following week there were 2 optional modules also due. Now, a student won't have 2 optional modules in a single Semester so it was decided to switch the core module due date and pull it forward (effectively switching the Core and Optional module assignment dates). For some students they will still have 3 assignments due but for others this now meant they had only 1 assignment due each week creating a better balance overall. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Several other items such as reviewing whole clusters of assignments and seeing where we would drop possible assignments into an enhancement week would reduce pressure but also where the type of assignments could be flexible. An example is an on line Job Interview as part of the TSE module in year 2. This takes 20% but is the type of assignment that can be more flexible than say a large project hand in. We also looked at 
    </p>

    <p>
     Overall, of the 8 proposals all of them were accepted and assignments re-dated. It is hoped that this provides as best overall balance across the timetable for each year group as possible. Although there are still pressure points (just before Feb 2021 is a key one for Year 2 as well as late Semester B for Year 3), these should be more easily managed with the flexibility to enhancement weeks provide earlier in the Semester.
    </p>

    <p>As always, these reviews are at their best when they are fully engaged with. I encourage every single SoCS student to get engaged and to make sure you put your reps to good use in these meetings. If you are not having the experience you want then please reach out and let us know. You can contact any one of us through our <b><a href="../../index.html#about">email links</a></b> or anonymously using our <b><a href="../../feedback.html">Feedback page</a></b>. All emails are received in the strictest of confidence. No concern or idea is too small.  </p>
