  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">October 12, 2020</h5> 

    <p>Once the Semester starts it is the duty of the Lincoln SU VP Education, <a href="https://lincolnsu.com/change-and-represent/leaders-and-officers" target="_blank">Georgia Petts</a>, to facilitate monthly meetings between all of the Senior Rep Group. The senior rep group are those students who have been nominated as a School Rep. There are circa 30 school reps across the University and this meeting was really well attended by almost all of them.</p>

    <p>Although this initial meeting was more of an introduction and review of the forward agenda, these meetings are in place to ensure your voice is heard at the highest level of the SU. Here, your School Rep can voice concerns and gather consensus on important matters affecting the student body.</p>

    <p>At todays meeting we all introduced ourselves and were asked to tell everyone our names, our school and one win we have recently had. the SoCS has had several 'wins' as we held a great set of social events and also have managed to field many questions and concerns raised at the start of the Semester. Several other schools also shared their success and they were around items of Peer Mentoring, leveraging social media to become more visible to setting up the foundational meetings with the heads of their respective schools to start off the whole representation process.</p>

    <p>I also heard many different ideas around a key campaign around inclusivity. As an example, even though as a University, Lincoln has a relatively high female:male ratio <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-lincoln#pane-data-stats" target="_blank">of 55:45</a>, the total percentage of female students is <a href="https://www.theuniguide.co.uk/university-of-lincoln-l39/courses/computer-science-bsc-hons-2021-dbf2f8ef1163" target="_blank">just 7%</a>. Nearly one of the lowest in the country. Contrast this to University of Manchester <a href="https://www.theuniguide.co.uk/university-of-manchester-m20/courses/computer-science-bsc-hons-2021-547efb68b244" target="_blank">where 23%</a> of Computer Science students are female but have a slightly lower female to male ratio of <a href="https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/universities/university-of-manchester" target="_blank">54:46</a>. This may indicate that it is not the University itself that is holding SoCS back from improving this but something more course orientated. It could be something as simple as the SoCS website itself <i>(which by the way is being reviewed as it is very male dominated in tone, imagery and language)</i>. This is where this panel and this campaign can help.</p>

    <p>This is just one small example of what these sorts of SRG meetings review. However, all talk and no action gets nothing done so there has to be some activity and progress to make a mark or 'move the needle'. This is where the School Reps come in and gather your thoughts and ideas about how to best engage and garner change for the better.</p>

    <p>The next SRG meeting will be held on the 23rd November so remember to keep on asking what is being discussed, how the School Rep is forwarding your ideas, and what changes are being made to ensure your experience is being constantly improved and made equal for all. </p>
