    <p>One of the most important ways SoCS identifies areas that can be improved is by receiving open and honest feedback from its student population throughout the year. We need <b>your</b> help to tell us what areas can be improved or if you think something has been done well (so we can do more of it). No concern or idea is too small.
    </p>

    <p>This Google Forms facility is a shared service that all university school reps have access to. This means that all responses can be read by any school rep across the university and by anyone with an '@lincolnsu.com' email. If you are not happy with this, you can contact any one of us through the email links on our <a href="index.html#about">Contact Us</a> page. All emails are received in the strictest of confidence. 
    </p>

    <p><b>NOTE: All feedback is anonymous. No personal information is needed to provide feedback.</b></p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">There were some organizational changes in SoCS in February with Kevin & Luc changing roles. I am unsure who the new Head of School or Deputy Head of School is in case I need to contact them. <br><b style="font-size:10px;">7 August 2020</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>On the 11th February 2020 an email was sent to all SoCS students detailing the changes that were being made to the school with respect to Kevin & Lucs role changes. This involved the Head of CoS acting as Interim Head of School with three directors in the College overseeing the general function and management of the school. Over the last few months a new Acting Head of School has recently been appointed, Dr Salah Al-Majeed. On the 7th August we requested that Salah send out a formal introduction to help introduce himself to the current student cohort which was done on the 10th August. It was noted by SoCS that the current organizational structure is confusing; to help with this we have asked for more clarification on who is who before the new academic year begins. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">When I enroll I update my details but they don't seem to change. I have tried this several times.<br><b style="font-size:10px;">13 July 2020</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>We contacted the School Admin who spoke with ICT. They said that it can take up to 24 hours for the system to show the update. We made 2 further requests on ICT and asked that they make a note above the button clarifying what the Update Details button was used for (just enrollment or all year round details change) and a note below the button saying that it will take 24 hours for changes to be seen. These have both been approved.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">Will I be able to get access to the INB Labs when University starts in October. My personal computer is not powerful enough to do some of the work required in the modules.<br><b style="font-size:10px;">10 July 2020</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>We emailed the school and the response was the INB Labs will be open but there may be some restrictions in place with regards to social distancing and health and safety. Additionally, remote machines are also being provisioned so students can access computational resource from their homes without a high-end machine. This is still work in progress and an official statement from the school about how things will be done going forwards will be sent in due time. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>We have spoken with the School at length about getting more information to the students about the specific changes being made to the SoCS Teaching and Learning for the 20/21 academic year. We have been told that several changes will take place and SoCS have committed to providing more clarifying information to students early August.</p>
