I've spoken to people from other schools and found that choosing their theme started last academic year.... <br><b style="font-size:10px;">8 December 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: Y3</b></button>
    <div class="content">

    <p><b>Question Cont ... </b><i> ... meanwhile we had a week. Then a 3 week 20% assignment (of a 3x module!!! that's 60%!!!) deadline while everyone was trying to settle in to a completely new university experience, while worrying about catching coronavirus and far from their loved ones? Who approved this? I'm so disappointed with how this has been handled, and know this is not the standard for the university, nor for the school going by information from previous students.".</i></p>

    <p>Thank you for raising this important topic. Feedback has been gathered from the Module lead (Dr Mark Doughty) which is below. I, as SoCS School Rep, have also added some context to help address some key points raised which are below.</p>

    <h4><b>Feedback by Project Module Lead</b></h4>

    <p>The Project allocations this year were an incremental step forwards from last year - when random allocation was made of student to academics, with no themes identified. This year we introduced the themes identification to better match students and academics. We don't introduce the theme selection until late in the summer/semester A start as there are a number of students who come to us late to study the third year (direct entrants from partner colleges, overseas students, etc). It has been felt for a while, that a delay in making project allocations would put all students on a more level playing field rather than allocating project supervisors during the previous year - meaning the students which enrol late would have a much reduced set of themes/supervisors to choose from. </p>

    <p>There is no 'standard' approach to projects and project allocations throughout the University. Each School/programme is free to decide how to best do this given their circumstances, the type of work which might be undertaken, the number of student/staff, etc. Admittedly we could probably do this better within our own constraints, which is why we look at project allocation methods and scheduling each year - we make incremental changes, if needed, to the project operation each year. It is a large undertaking which we try to improve each year, and we will take this feedback on board when we look at the project for next year.</p>

    <h4><b>Response by Garry</b></h4>

    <p><b>Project Selection</b> - The themes provided were only guides to help with project selection. Students were able to forward a personal project as long as it fit the criteria. The 3rd year project has been a key module for many years and it has been an expectation that students think about their dissertation project even from the beginning of year 2. There was also the opportunity this year to pre-select a project focus and potential supervisor via the UVROS programme in July of this year. </p>

    <p><b>20% assignment weighting</b> - For clarification the first assessment for the Project module is 20% and the total project module itself  has a CAT score of 45 points (1 x module has a CAT score of 15 points). So as is rightly pointed out the project is worth 3 modules worth of CAT points, however, if summed, the 60% total value of this assignment should be compared to the total available points across all modules which is 60%/800% or 7.5% of the total available grades for the year.</p>

    <p><b>3 week first assignment deadline</b> - All assignment deadlines were reviewed by the School Rep (Garry Clawson) and academic staff and approved by the Director of Teaching and Learning (Chris Headleand). With my participation I am able to then add comment and request changes where there may be bunching or clashing of assignments. This year we made 8 changes from the proposed assignment timetable and the reps wrote a full blog about this process which can be found <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="posts/blogs/assignmentTimetableReview_BLOG.html">here</a>. The initial project time line was not one of the requested changes. However, this project lead time was specifically discussed. It was explained that this assignment lead time was due to experiences across previous years where the first assignment was not due until the 5th Dec. This caused significant issues as in several circumstances students had at that stage (end of Semester A) not yet fully clarified their projects or even met with their supervisor as they used the 1st assignment as a milestone for this initial discussion. Due to this it was considered, on the whole, better to have a tighter deadline to ensure that all students have full time to complete their project specifications and to support those who had not yet found something as early as possible in the academic year. This on the whole was thought to enable a much better project delivery in the 60% and final 20% sections, overall leading to improved marks for their project dissertation.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">The brief for our Level 3 Project proposal (Item 1) has some discrepancies both in its content and with lecturer's statements. Please can this be addressed? ... <br><b style="font-size:10px;">23 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: Y3</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Question Cont ... </b><i>Both in an update to the brief, and in an official announcement of the changes - clear communication is necessary for remote study to be viable.  - The brief makes no mention of a cover page, even though the program leader has confirmed we should include one. - The brief states the proposal should include a "...review of project progress.", but the listed 7 sections do not account for such. How can we review progress made on a project that has not yet even been proposed?  It should also be noted that the cohort received the brief late (and - initially - partially incomplete), as defined by the opening statement "[...][briefs] should be made available prior to the commencement of the module [...]".</i></p>


      <p>Due to the size of the question I have broken it into 2 parts: 

        <ol>
          <li>Response for clarification of the brief with respect to conflicts on written requirements and then verbal requirements made during lectures.</li>
          <li>Ability to release Year 3 Project Briefs prior to module commencement</li>
        </ol> 

      <p><b>Item 1</b>: We have contacted the module lead, Mark Doughty, and have received a response early this morning (26.10.2020). Both items above were pointed out and Mark confirmed that there was some wording discrepancies but they should be clear within the context of the requirements. However, he did note that he will clarify the requirements shortly (expected to be during the next lecture). Regarding the requirement to have a progress review in the assignment report, this seems to have been an overhang from a previous year and once pointed out it was accepted that this wording was again a discrepancy. I have asked that both these items be cleared up by resubmitting the pdf brief, so that any wording discrepancies that can clearly lead to a misinterpretation are removed and the brief to clearly reflect the full intent of the CRG requirements. Mark also confirmed during the lecture that he will update the pdf brief also updating the word count section regarding references. </p>

      <p><b>Item 2</b>: It is with the school to decide when to release the briefs for assignments. However, there is opportunity at the beginning of the academic year for changes to be applied and the School Rep works with the school on this. Historically assignment briefs are only released upon assignment release date. This is the due date minus the time allocated to complete the assignment. It has not been known that a assignment brief be released before a module has begun. But as this is the Project and main dissertation for Level 3 it may be useful to see this brief immediately from week 1 lectures and will make this recommendation with the above question.</p>

    <div class="content">
  		<p>We have contacted the Module Lead who said that this was also noticed by the team today. The reason highlighted for this was due to the many Module changes over the summer, which led to some of the documents being missed upon converting to PDF format. These documents will be re-uploaded as PDFs. SoCS Admin is also being contacted to check all other documents to ensure they are PDF. Thanks for raising this!</p>

  		<p>It was also highlighted that there is also the option using the accessibility button (small down arrow button adjacent to the document) that may also provide a PDF download option. However, PDFs are the standard and it was acknowledged that CRGs and Briefs should be in that format to start with.</p>

      <p>It has been confirmed that Blackboard is the default location for all links to  Videos and documentation. Chris Headleand will be sending out an email Friday (16th Oct) to clarify this and make sure there are no problems with access.</p>

  		<p><i>Note: Some lecturers have responded that they will also post the video links in the MS Teams channel to allow access but the default location for linking to all documents is via Blackboard.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">Instead of MS Teams lecture why not a recorded lecture PLUS a live MS Teams Q and A session to discuss the lecture content. Mixing the two doesn't work? <br><b style="font-size:10px;">14 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Some modules will be fully blended in their teaching and learning styles. Cloud Computing (Y3) for instance, will have pre-recorded lectures where content is available early and then a general discussion forum during the live lecture session. This creates a space for the discussion while still allowing those who wish to review the lecture materials without distraction to do that. </p>

      <p>The mix of blended and live lecture is still being worked on and if students show a strong preference for all modules to have pre-recorded lectures then a live discussion we will make that request to the school. If you have a module that you think could be better serviced by having pre-recorded lectures then a live discussion please let us know and we will take that forwards to the school during the academic panel discussions. </p>

      <p>The Module leads have found the videos (they are Panopto) and will look to remove or lower some of the backing music to improve the clarity of the speakers voice and remove potential distraction going forwards. Thanks for the raising this. Small change but can have a large impact!</p>

     <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">The Bid Data module introduction was mainly a repeat of some Maths and Stats that we have previously been through. It would have been great to cover what the field of Big Data is all about, and any current research on it, who are the guys to follow (papers, texts, videos etc) and read up on. Can this be relayed back to the Module coordinators. <br><b style="font-size:10px;">14 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: Y3</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This point has been relayed back to the Module Coordinators who were grateful for the feedback. They note that there is a steep learning curve on the Maths side coming from week 2 onwards and a review was thought to be helpful to those who are not as confident.</p>

      <p>It was noted in parallel that the Module title of 'Big Data' may be misleading as the module is really an introduction to Data Science and how to apply them to Big Datasets, rather than the foundation of Data Science, which is a precursor to the more detailed concepts of Big Data Analytics and Modeling which is a Masters module. </p>

      <p>It was also noted that the feedback from the students during the lecture is key to help gauge the audience's understanding so a high level of interaction can help move past topics quicker if that is what is being shown. To this end it was requested that additional tools such as 'in chat Polls' be used as this may get a faster response. This recommendation was well received. </p>

      <p>Due to term time changes and also to ensure that every student has the best opportunities through the academic year new "enhancement weeks" have been installed in the Semester timetable. These will be a structured set of extracurricular opportunities - including things like certification and hacks. It is also the hope to host things like portfolio development sessions, and activities with the careers team. Although the timetable is not completely confirmed as of writing (10th September 2020), most of these activities will be announced during the welcome week, so please make sure you catch each of these timetabled sessions. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>On the 11th February 2020 an email was sent to all SoCS students detailing the changes that were being made to the school with respect to Kevin & Luc's role changes. This involved the Head of CoS acting as Interim Head of School with three directors in the College overseeing the general function and management of the school. Over the last few months a new Acting Head of School has recently been appointed, Dr Salah Al-Majeed. On the 7th August we requested that Salah send out a formal introduction to help introduce himself to the current student cohort which was done on the 10th August. It was noted by SoCS that the current organizational structure is confusing; to help with this we have asked for more clarification on who is who before the new academic year begins. </p>
