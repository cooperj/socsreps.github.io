I find that I have to thoroughly read and re-read the instructions multiple times before I can complete the assignment, and even then I am confused as to what is being asked - a lot of the details are not provided, which leads to some uncertainty.

    	<p><i>I also feel that the assignments are not properly articulated in the first place. I have found that the instructions are often vague, and it is difficult to understand the assignment. For example, the instructions in the assignment are not clearly explained, and often contain vague statements and language.

    	<p><i>This is not the first time in the year that I have had an assignment that has been very confusing and vague, and I feel that the University needs to make some improvements to the way they communicate with students.</i></p>

    	<p><i>I am not sure the best way to give feedback, however I feel as though the University could do with some improvements in the assignment instructions.</i></p>

  		<p>Thank you very much for the comment and questions. First, I just want to make sure you know of places you can formally raise this feedback. <a href="https://lincolnsu.com/course-mate" target="_blank">Coursemate</a> is a LincolnSU portal which allows students to directly raise issues with course reps about modules. The reps have to provide a response within a time period and no details of the person who raised the issue are shared with the reps (but the SU will know who they are). The LIncoln SU follows up each and every Coursemate item. Additionally, the <a href="https://socsreps.github.io/posts/blogs/moduleEvaluations_BLOG.html" target="_blank">Module Evaluations</a>, which take place twice per year (Once each semester) is alos a formal place to raise these details with all comments going to programme leads for review.</p>

  		<p>As an overview as a SoCS rep, one of the items that the university I know works hard on is the Assignments and briefs. Many changes took place for the 20/21 academic year due to Covid and trying to make sure the assessments were 'Covid Proof' - i.e. would not impact a students ability to do well due to the pandemic - this may mean changing in class tests to TCA's. Every assignment and test had to go through a completely fresh review and then be approved to ensure they met relevant degree level standards.</p>

  		<p>The quality of assignment briefs is reviewed now (as I understand) 5 times before they are released and a new process has recently (start of academic year) been introduced. However, several students have shared this same view of assignment brief quality, especially around specifics within the brief itself that have created ambiguity and sometimes contradiction with parts of the CRG. This occurred recently on a 2nd year AI brief which was resolved but only through emails to lecturers, which shouldn't be needed.</p>

  		<p>To follow this through I will raise this with the Director of Teaching and Learning and specifically request review of the assignment process. Additionally, to give further assurance, I will also raise this at the <a href="https://socsreps.github.io/posts/blogs/subjectCommitteeMeeting_BLOG.html" target="_blank">SoCS UG Subject Committee</a>. The Subject Committee has formal minutes with full programme lead attendance so are actioned and followed up several times.</p>

  		<p>I hope this response is suitable. Thanks again for the questions.</p>

      <p>Thank you very much for the question. This is a really great idea and I know that BlackBoard allows email notifications if a new item is raised in a course Module and hope that this idea could be a simple addition to this.</p>

      <p>The best place to raise ideas is via the <a href="https://lincolnsu.com/suggestions" target="_blank">SUggestions</a> portal. This portal ensures that all ideas are raised, responded to and public. It also allows other students support the idea.</p>

      <p>Additionally, I have regular meetings with the school and will raise this idea through the College of Science monthly meetings and Senior Rep Group meetings to provide more visibility.

This is because the only devices I have at home that can connect to the Internet are my smartphone and Xbox.

As such, I was planning to return to Lincoln today to resume working on my assessments but with the new announcement I am now unable to return to Lincoln and am stuck in a position where I am very fearful as I do not have the resources to complete my work.  I imagine that there are likely other students who are also in this predicament.  I sincerely ask that you push the school for assignment extensions, I am currently doing well in my degree and would hate for this to be my downfall.  May I suggest a Google Forms survey being sent out to all students ASAP to determine how many others are also having their work inhibited by the lockdown rules or current state of affairs and how many people feel they would benefit from an extension?</i></p>

  		<p>Thank you very much for the question. This was initially tricky so I have spoken with the SoCS Director of Teaching and Learning, The SU VP of Education and also the SoCS reps to try and get best advice to you. They were each very helpful and understood your concern but half way through collating a response an internal email was received by all students which solidified the feedback I had been given. However, I always want to note that the very first thing is to always let your Personal Tutor know if you are facing an struggles (even if you have not had them yet) as they can help. Regarding the question, please see the recent email entitled 'Prime Minister&apos;s Announcement on New National Lockdown - Message for Students' on the 5th Jan 2021 at 16:42.</p>

  		<p>Paragraph 7 of the communication states <b>"However, if you are unable to access online learning from your current location, for example because you do not have suitable study space, <mark>or access to essential equipment,</mark> or where you are currently living is not a safe place for you, or you require specific support such as support for your mental health; <mark>then you can move back to Lincoln to access these facilities"</mark>.</b></p>

		<p>I know the question was posed before this email was provided. I hope that the highlighted text helps also provide an answer. If not, or further clarification is needed please contact your PT who will be able to give more advice, especially around extensions and what requirements there are for submission. If you are not sure where the extension request details are please see the FAQs link above or contact socsadmin@lincoln.ac.uk.</p>

      <p>We do try were ever possible to try and parse feedback comments into suitable questions so that we can obtain a response and add this to the Feedback section for everyone to see. This can be seen from previous questions where they have been broken down into several sections. If we are not able to parse a question (or questions) from within the feedback submitted, as the feedback is a general view or opinion on a subject - which is still very valid - no response will be posted into the Feedback section (as there is no question to be responded back to).

    <p><b>Question Cont ... </b><i> ... meanwhile we had a week. Then a 3 week 20% assignment (of a 3x module!!! that's 60%!!!) deadline while everyone was trying to settle in to a completely new university experience, while worrying about catching coronavirus and far from their loved ones? Who approved this? I'm so disappointed with how this has been handled, and know this is not the standard for the university, nor for the school going by information from previous students.".</i></p>

    <p>Thank you for raising this important topic. Feedback has been gathered from the Module lead (Dr Mark Doughty) which is below. I, as SoCS School Rep, have also added some context to help address some key points raised which are below.</p>

    <h4><b>Feedback by Project Module Lead</b></h4>

    <p>The Project allocations this year were an incremental step forwards from last year - when random allocation was made of student to academics, with no themes identified. This year we introduced the themes identification to better match students and academics. We don't introduce the theme selection until late in the summer/semester A start as there are a number of students who come to us late to study the third year (direct entrants from partner colleges, overseas students, etc). It has been felt for a while, that a delay in making project allocations would put all students on a more level playing field rather than allocating project supervisors during the previous year - meaning the students which enrol late would have a much reduced set of themes/supervisors to choose from. </p>

    <p>There is no 'standard' approach to projects and project allocations throughout the University. Each School/programme is free to decide how to best do this given their circumstances, the type of work which might be undertaken, the number of student/staff, etc. Admittedly we could probably do this better within our own constraints, which is why we look at project allocation methods and scheduling each year - we make incremental changes, if needed, to the project operation each year. It is a large undertaking which we try to improve each year, and we will take this feedback on board when we look at the project for next year.</p>

    <h4><b>Response by Garry</b></h4>

    <p><b>Project Selection</b> - The themes provided were only guides to help with project selection. Students were able to forward a personal project as long as it fit the criteria. The 3rd year project has been a key module for many years and it has been an expectation that students think about their dissertation project even from the beginning of year 2. There was also the opportunity this year to pre-select a project focus and potential supervisor via the UVROS programme in July of this year. </p>

    <p><b>20% assignment weighting</b> - For clarification the first assessment for the Project module is 20% and the total project module itself  has a CAT score of 45 points (1 x module has a CAT score of 15 points). So as is rightly pointed out the project is worth 3 modules worth of CAT points, however, if summed, the 60% total value of this assignment should be compared to the total available points across all modules which is 60%/800% or 7.5% of the total available grades for the year.</p>

    <p><b>3 week first assignment deadline</b> - All assignment deadlines were reviewed by the School Rep (Garry Clawson) and academic staff and approved by the Director of Teaching and Learning (Chris Headleand). With my participation I am able to then add comment and request changes where there may be bunching or clashing of assignments. This year we made 8 changes from the proposed assignment timetable and the reps wrote a full blog about this process which can be found <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="posts/blogs/assignmentTimetableReview_BLOG.html">here</a>. The initial project time line was not one of the requested changes. However, this project lead time was specifically discussed. It was explained that this assignment lead time was due to experiences across previous years where the first assignment was not due until the 5th Dec. This caused significant issues as in several circumstances students had at that stage (end of Semester A) not yet fully clarified their projects or even met with their supervisor as they used the 1st assignment as a milestone for this initial discussion. Due to this it was considered, on the whole, better to have a tighter deadline to ensure that all students have full time to complete their project specifications and to support those who had not yet found something as early as possible in the academic year. This on the whole was thought to enable a much better project delivery in the 60% and final 20% sections, overall leading to improved marks for their project dissertation.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">The brief for our Level 3 Project proposal (Item 1) has some discrepancies both in its content and with lecturer's statements. Please can this be addressed? ... <br><b style="font-size:10px;">23 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: Y3</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Question Cont ... </b><i>Both in an update to the brief, and in an official announcement of the changes - clear communication is necessary for remote study to be viable.  - The brief makes no mention of a cover page, even though the program leader has confirmed we should include one. - The brief states the proposal should include a "...review of project progress.", but the listed 7 sections do not account for such. How can we review progress made on a project that has not yet even been proposed?  It should also be noted that the cohort received the brief late (and - initially - partially incomplete), as defined by the opening statement "[...][briefs] should be made available prior to the commencement of the module [...]".</i></p>


      <p>Due to the size of the question I have broken it into 2 parts: 

        <ol>
          <li>Response for clarification of the brief with respect to conflicts on written requirements and then verbal requirements made during lectures.</li>
          <li>Ability to release Year 3 Project Briefs prior to module commencement</li>
        </ol> 

      <p><b>Item 1</b>: We have contacted the module lead, Mark Doughty, and have received a response early this morning (26.10.2020). Both items above were pointed out and Mark confirmed that there was some wording discrepancies but they should be clear within the context of the requirements. However, he did note that he will clarify the requirements shortly (expected to be during the next lecture). Regarding the requirement to have a progress review in the assignment report, this seems to have been an overhang from a previous year and once pointed out it was accepted that this wording was again a discrepancy. I have asked that both these items be cleared up by resubmitting the pdf brief, so that any wording discrepancies that can clearly lead to a misinterpretation are removed and the brief to clearly reflect the full intent of the CRG requirements. Mark also confirmed during the lecture that he will update the pdf brief also updating the word count section regarding references. </p>

      <p><b>Item 2</b>: It is with the school to decide when to release the briefs for assignments. However, there is opportunity at the beginning of the academic year for changes to be applied and the School Rep works with the school on this. Historically assignment briefs are only released upon assignment release date. This is the due date minus the time allocated to complete the assignment. It has not been known that a assignment brief be released before a module has begun. But as this is the Project and main dissertation for Level 3 it may be useful to see this brief immediately from week 1 lectures and will make this recommendation with the above question.</p>

  		<p>We have contacted the Module Lead who said that this was also noticed by the team today. The reason highlighted for this was due to the many Module changes over the summer, which led to some of the documents being missed upon converting to PDF format. These documents will be re-uploaded as PDFs. SoCS Admin is also being contacted to check all other documents to ensure they are PDF. Thanks for raising this!</p>

  		<p>It was also highlighted that there is also the option using the accessibility button (small down arrow button adjacent to the document) that may also provide a PDF download option. However, PDFs are the standard and it was acknowledged that CRGs and Briefs should be in that format to start with.</p>

      <p>Some modules will be fully blended in their teaching and learning styles. Cloud Computing (Y3) for instance, will have pre-recorded lectures where content is available early and then a general discussion forum during the live lecture session. This creates a space for the discussion while still allowing those who wish to review the lecture materials without distraction to do that. </p>

      <p>The mix of blended and live lecture is still being worked on and if students show a strong preference for all modules to have pre-recorded lectures then a live discussion we will make that request to the school. If you have a module that you think could be better serviced by having pre-recorded lectures then a live discussion please let us know and we will take that forwards to the school during the academic panel discussions. </p>

     <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">The Bid Data module introduction was mainly a repeat of some Maths and Stats that we have previously been through. It would have been great to cover what the field of Big Data is all about, and any current research on it, who are the guys to follow (papers, texts, videos etc) and read up on. Can this be relayed back to the Module coordinators. <br><b style="font-size:10px;">14 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: Y3</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This point has been relayed back to the Module Coordinators who were grateful for the feedback. They note that there is a steep learning curve on the Maths side coming from week 2 onwards and a review was thought to be helpful to those who are not as confident.</p>

      <p>It was noted in parallel that the Module title of 'Big Data' may be misleading as the module is really an introduction to Data Science and how to apply them to Big Datasets, rather than the foundation of Data Science, which is a precursor to the more detailed concepts of Big Data Analytics and Modeling which is a Masters module. </p>

      <p>It was also noted that the feedback from the students during the lecture is key to help gauge the audience's understanding so a high level of interaction can help move past topics quicker if that is what is being shown. To this end it was requested that additional tools such as 'in chat Polls' be used as this may get a faster response. This recommendation was well received. </p>

These will be a structured set of extracurricular opportunities - including things like certification and hacks. It is also the hope to host things like portfolio development sessions, and activities with the careers team.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">Will registers still be used in the 20/21 academic year? How would I sign these? <br><b style="font-size:10px;">11 September 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The current information is that there won't be any paper registers (in semester A at least), but engagement will still be monitored (participation in on line sessions, formative assessments etc). More information on this will be presented during the orientation week so please make sure you catch each of these timetabled sessions. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">There were some organizational changes in SoCS in February with Kevin & Luc changing roles. I am unsure who the new Head of School or Deputy Head of School is in case I need to contact them. <br><b style="font-size:10px;">7 August 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>On the 11th February 2020 an email was sent to all SoCS students detailing the changes that were being made to the school with respect to Kevin & Luc's role changes. This involved the Head of CoS acting as Interim Head of School with three directors in the College overseeing the general function and management of the school. Over the last few months a new Acting Head of School has recently been appointed, Dr Salah Al-Majeed. On the 7th August we requested that Salah send out a formal introduction to help introduce himself to the current student cohort which was done on the 10th August. It was noted by SoCS that the current organizational structure is confusing; to help with this we have asked for more clarification on who is who before the new academic year begins. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">When I enroll I update my details but they don't seem to change. I have tried this several times.<br><b style="font-size:10px;">13 July 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>We contacted the School Admin who spoke with ICT. They said that it can take up to 24 hours for the system to show the update. We made 2 further requests on ICT and asked that they make a note above the button clarifying what the Update Details button was used for (just enrollment or all year round details change) and a note below the button saying that it will take 24 hours for changes to be seen. These have both been approved.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">Will I be able to get access to the INB Labs when University starts in October. My personal computer is not powerful enough to do some of the work required in the modules.<br><b style="font-size:10px;">10 July 2020  &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>We emailed the school and the response was the INB Labs will be open but there may be some restrictions in place with regards to social distancing and health and safety. Additionally, remote machines are also being provisioned so students can access computational resource from their homes without a high-end machine. This is still work in progress and an official statement from the school about how things will be done going forwards will be sent in due time. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>We have spoken with the School at length about getting more information to the students about the specific changes being made to the SoCS Teaching and Learning for the 20/21 academic year. We have been told that several changes will take place and SoCS have committed to providing more clarifying information to students early August.</p>
