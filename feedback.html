    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">The brief for our Level 3 Project proposal (Item 1) has some discrepancies both in its content and with lecturer's statements. Please can this be addressed? ... <br><b style="font-size:10px;">23 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: Y3</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Question Cont ... </b><i>Both in an update to the brief, and in an official announcement of the changes - clear communication is necessary for remote study to be viable.  - The brief makes no mention of a cover page, even though the program leader has confirmed we should include one. - The brief states the proposal should include a "...review of project progress.", but the listed 7 sections do not account for such. How can we review progress made on a project that has not yet even been proposed?  It should also be noted that the cohort received the brief late (and - initially - partially incomplete), as defined by the opening statement "[...][briefs] should be made available prior to the commencement of the module [...]".</i></p>


      <p>Due to the size of the question I have broken it into 2 parts: 

        <ol>
          <li>Response for clarification of the brief with respect to conflicts on written requirements and then verbal requirements made during lectures.</li>
          <li>Ability to release Year 3 Project Briefs prior to module commencement</li>
        </ol> 

      <p><b>Item 1</b>: We have contacted the module lead, Mark Doughty, and have received a response early this morning (26.10.2020). Both items above were pointed out and Mark confirmed that there was some wording discrepancies but they should be clear within the context of the requirements. However, he did note that he will clarify the requirements shortly (expected to be during the next lecture). Regarding the requirement to have a progress review in the assignment report, this seems to have been an overhang from a previous year and once pointed out it was accepted that this wording was again a discrepancy. I have asked that both these items be cleared up by resubmitting the pdf brief so that any wording discrepancies that can clearly lead to a misinterpretation are removed and the brief to clearly reflect the full intent of the CRG requirements without this additional interpretation.</p>

      <p><b>Item 2</b>: It is with the school to decide when to release the briefs for assignments. However, there is opportunity at the beginning of the academic year for changes to be applied and the School Rep works with the school on this. Historically assignment briefs are only released upon assignment release date. This is the due date minus the time allocated to complete the assignment. It has not been known that a assignment brief be released before a module has begun. But as this is the Project and main dissertation for Level 3 it may be useful to see this brief immediately from week 1 lectures and will make this recommendation with the above question.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">Level 3 Graphics: Can I request that Assessment 1's Brief and CRG is uploaded as a PDF as per School Guidelines?

    <div class="content">
  		<p>We have contacted the Module Lead who said that this was also noticed by the team today. The reason highlighted for this was due to the many Module changes over the summer, which led to some of the documents being missed upon converting to PDF format. These documents will be re-uploaded as PDFs. SoCS Admin is also being contacted to check all other documents to ensure they are PDF. Thanks for raising this!</p>

  		<p>It was also highlighted that there is also the option using the accessibility button (small down arrow button adjacent to the document) that may also provide a PDF download option. However, PDFs are the standard and it was acknowledged that CRGs and Briefs should be in that format to start with.</p>

     <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">Please can we be given official guidance on where to find recorded lectures? Is there a centralized hub, or place on blackboard? Is there a component of teams that affords this? <br><b style="font-size:10px;">15 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>It has been confirmed that Blackboard is the default location for all links to  Videos and documentation. Chris Headleand will be sending out an email Friday (16th Oct) to clarify this and make sure there are no problems with access.</p>

  		<p><i>Note: Some lecturers have responded that they will also post the video links in the MS Teams channel to allow access but the default location for linking to all documents is via Blackboard. If you do see any formal documentation that is not linked in Blackboard please let us know.</i></p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">Instead of MS Teams lecture why not a recorded lecture PLUS a live MS Teams Q and A session to discuss the lecture content. Mixing the two doesn't work? <br><b style="font-size:10px;">14 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Some modules will be fully blended in their teaching and learning styles. Cloud Computing (Y3) for instance, will have pre-recorded lectures where content is available early and then a general discussion forum during the live lecture session. This creates a space for the discussion while still allowing those who wish to review the lecture materials without distraction to do that. </p>

      <p>The mix of blended and live lecture is still being worked on and if students show a strong preference for all modules to have pre-recorded lectures then a live discussion we will make that request to the school. If you have a module that you think could be better serviced by having pre-recorded lectures then a live discussion please let us know and we will take that forwards to the school during the academic panel discussions. </p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">The pre-recorded videos for Level 3 optional Module Graphics have backing music which nearly overpowers the speaker's voice and is quite distracting.

    <div class="content">
      <p>The Module leads have found the videos (they are Panopto) and will look to remove or lower some of the backing music to improve the clarity of the speakers voice and remove potential distraction going forwards. Thanks for the raising this. Small change but can have a large impact!</p>

     <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">The Bid Data module introduction was mainly a repeat of some Maths and Stats that we have previously been through. It would have been great to cover what the field of Big Data is all about, and any current research on it, who are the guys to follow (papers, texts, videos etc) and read up on. Can this be relayed back to the Module coordinators. <br><b style="font-size:10px;">14 October 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: Y3</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This point has been relayed back to the Module Coordinators who were grateful for the feedback. They note that there is a steep learning curve on the Maths side coming from week 2 onwards and a review was thought to be helpful to those who are not as confident.</p>

      <p>It was noted in parallel that the Module title of 'Big Data' may be misleading as the module is really an introduction to Data Science and how to apply them to Big Datasets, rather than the foundation of Data Science, which is a precursor to the more detailed concepts of Big Data Analytics and Modeling which is a Masters module. </p>

      <p>It was also noted that the feedback from the students during the lecture is key to help gauge the audience's understanding so a high level of interaction can help move past topics quicker if that is what is being shown. To this end it was requested that additional tools such as 'in chat Polls' be used as this may get a faster response. This recommendation was well received. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">I understand that we will now have reading weeks. What are they and how will they work? <br><b style="font-size:10px;">11 September 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Due to term time changes and also to ensure that every student has the best opportunities through the academic year new "enhancement weeks" have been installed in the Semester timetable. These will be a structured set of extracurricular opportunities - including things like certification and hacks. It is also the hope to host things like portfolio development sessions, and activities with the careers team. Although the timetable is not completely confirmed as of writing (10th September 2020), most of these activities will be announced during the welcome week, so please make sure you catch each of these timetabled sessions. </p>

      <p>The current information is that there won't be any paper registers (in semester A at least), but engagement will still be monitored (participation in on line sessions, formative assessments etc). More information on this will be presented during the orientation week so please make sure you catch each of these timetabled sessions. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 18px">There were some organizational changes in SoCS in February with Kevin & Luc changing roles. I am unsure who the new Head of School or Deputy Head of School is in case I need to contact them. <br><b style="font-size:10px;">7 August 2020 &emsp; Applicable to Year Group: All</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>On the 11th February 2020 an email was sent to all SoCS students detailing the changes that were being made to the school with respect to Kevin & Luc's role changes. This involved the Head of CoS acting as Interim Head of School with three directors in the College overseeing the general function and management of the school. Over the last few months a new Acting Head of School has recently been appointed, Dr Salah Al-Majeed. On the 7th August we requested that Salah send out a formal introduction to help introduce himself to the current student cohort which was done on the 10th August. It was noted by SoCS that the current organizational structure is confusing; to help with this we have asked for more clarification on who is who before the new academic year begins. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>We contacted the School Admin who spoke with ICT. They said that it can take up to 24 hours for the system to show the update. We made 2 further requests on ICT and asked that they make a note above the button clarifying what the Update Details button was used for (just enrollment or all year round details change) and a note below the button saying that it will take 24 hours for changes to be seen. These have both been approved.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>We emailed the school and the response was the INB Labs will be open but there may be some restrictions in place with regards to social distancing and health and safety. Additionally, remote machines are also being provisioned so students can access computational resource from their homes without a high-end machine. This is still work in progress and an official statement from the school about how things will be done going forwards will be sent in due time. </p>
