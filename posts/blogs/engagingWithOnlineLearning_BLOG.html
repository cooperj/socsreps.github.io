  <h5 style="color:grey">September 13, 2020</h5> 

    <p>You may be wondering what the new academic year holds and thinking abut how you can make the most of it. There are a few things I have been told that can help you get 100% more out of your learning experience. These simple steps will not only help you but will also help your tutors, and help your fellow students. A great place to start is by reading our very own <a href="https://chrisheadleand.com/2020/09/08/student-engagement-in-the-digital-classroom/">Chris Headleand's blog</a>. This is full of extremely useful hints and tips about online learning, preparing yourself for the new term as well as what to expect when you return. All from a lecturers perspective.</p>

    <h3>Turn on your camera</h3>

    <p>This may initially sound weird and you certainly don't have to do it but being able to read the room, using body language, is impossible if the lecturer can't see who they are engaging with. As students we can make an immediate positive impact for everyone on the call by being seen to be present and engaged. There are loads of tools to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-your-background-for-a-teams-meeting-f77a2381-443a-499d-825e-509a140f4780">blur or even add a background image</a> to your screen and these are all built into Teams and activated by a single click so make use of these.</p>

    <h3>Ask questions</h3>

    <p>One benefit of online learning is that you can ask a question in loads of different ways. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/raise-your-hand-in-a-teams-meeting-bb2dd8e1-e6bd-43a6-85cf-30822667b372">Raising your hand</a>, using the <a href="https://techlab.ytria.com/using-the-chat-feature-in-a-meeting-with-microsoft-teams/">chat</a> feature, or simply by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhsdzDKufTc">turning on your mic</a> and asking a question directly. If you have ever presented for even 10 minutes and asked for questions, and then don't receive any, it can be extremely discouraging. Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss said that <i>"The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers, he's one who asks the right questions."</i> Never be afraid to ask for clarifying context. There are many ways to <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/success-guide/ug/effective-study/in-class-and-in-lectures/asking-questions/">ask questions</a> and if you can challenge yourself to ask at least 1 question during every lecture or seminar then you will be 1 answer better off. </p>

    <h3>Actively participate</h3>

    <p>The lecturers this year will have <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/08/reimagining-virtual-collaboration-future-work-learning/">many new tools</a> to help guage student understanding ranging from in chat surveys to group bubbles and much much more. these tools are there to identify where more emphasis on certain points is needed during the lecture or seminar. Every lecture won't be the same and not all classes learn all points at the same rate, so it is critical that students actively participate during these sessions. This will allow a lecturer to refocus and find a new way to explain key points. Even if this is needed 5 x in a single lecture, don't worry, it is much better to really get a class to understand a point during lecture than have 200 students ask after! </p>

    <h3>Encourage others</h3>

    <p>Online learning by its very nature creates a social environment. It is not often you are on screen with 200+ people! It can be disheartening if you ask a question or make a point and someone makes a joke or knocks it back. It not only dissuades further questions but also increases anxiety about asking anything further. If you see a question then use the tools such as "thumbs up" or "smiley face" emoji's to show support and encourage others to participate. The lecture will be that much better for it.</p>

    <h3>Read the materials</h3>

    <p>This year will include a lot of <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/flipped-learning">"Flipped Learning"</a> and this relies a lot on the student being pro-active and engaging with the learning materials <b>prior</b> to the live online discussion seminars. Unfortunately, no one can do this reading for you but I can assure you that you will be in a 100 x better position going into the discussion seminars even just having an overview of the material than not doing anything at all. You will only get out what you put in and it is much easier done bit by bit through the Semester than trying to catch up in one large chunk.</p>

    <h3>Ask early when you need help</h3>

    <p>Every body needs help, guidance and support. Your best is often never achieved alone. You only have so much time and there is a fantastic learning and support environment at the University of Lincoln and within SoCS itself, so put it to good use. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irPdRs2FeTk">Always ask for help when you need it</a>. Online learning and flipped learning methods are new and everyone will have questions at some time, so you will certainly not be alone. If you are ever unsure then contact your <a href="../../faq.html#tutor">personal tutor</a> and they can help point you in the right direction.</p>

    <h3>Reduce distractions</h3>

    <p>Distractions can be caused by loads of different things, even your cat jumping up, your dog barking in the background or even your house mates being a bit too loud. Although this may be an obvious thing it can be really reduce your experience so try and find a place where you can nest in and apply 100% focus to the lectures and seminars. </p>
