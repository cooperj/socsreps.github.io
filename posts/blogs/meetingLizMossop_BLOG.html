  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">September 22, 2020</h5> 

    <p>Today I had the really great opportunity to meet with <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/2895826c-936a-4615-a9c9-148f6630bf63">Prof Liz Mossop</a> who is the Deputy Vice Chancellor for Student Development and Engagement at the University of Lincoln. This meeting was kindly arranged by the Lincoln SU VP of Education, <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/2895826c-936a-4615-a9c9-148f6630bf63">Georgia Petts</a> and included around 25 (ish) School reps along with the respective College reps. Our rep for the College of Science is Jack Eame's. These meetings are all about sharing feedback and getting the senior university team hear <b>your voice</b>. 
    </p>

    <p>Georgia opened the meeting with introductions and an overview of what the meeting was about. Todays session was around general introductions as the schools begin to slowly open (some are already open for students), and to hear any initial feedback or upcoming concerns and take questions.</p>

    <p>Liz the provided an overview of what the University on a whole has been doing over the last half year as well as discussion points around items such as timetabling, the health and safety processes that have been put in place, how the schools are working with external boards to ensure all exams and curriculum requirements are not only met but exceeded as well as a host of other items. Further points around what students should expect when the return to university were also touched on from physical perspective with defined walkways and more open spaces (such as the Engine Shed).</p>

    <p>Some of the most interesting points discussed were during the question and answer session towards the end of the meeting. Items such as building opening hours, what changes to things to like such as attendance monitoring are taking place, will students be required to wear face shields on all parts of the campus or will face coverings be ok, how will 'teaching bubbles' work and what do they mean and so on. The great news is that much of this information will be released over the next few days with an update from the University, so keep an eye out for that.</p>

    <p>Overall, the meeting lasted around 1 hour and even though we discussed lots of topics there was clearly lots of further thoughts still to collect. On that basis we were invited to keep our respective schools informed and supported with as much feedback as possible to ensure not just a good experience, but a great experience to the start of this upcoming semester.</p>

    <p>On the above basis I ask you to send your ideas, thoughts, concerns and anything in between to the course reps and me so that we can all take part in being One Community and continually improving the student experience.</p>

    <p>These meetings are a great way to make yourself heard. I encourage every single SoCS student to get engaged and to make sure you put your reps to good use in these meetings. If you are not having the experience you want then please reach out and let us know. You can contact any one of us through our <b><a href="../../index.html#about">email links</a></b> or anonymously using our <b><a href="../../feedback.html">Feedback page</a></b>. All emails are received in the strictest of confidence. No concern or idea is too small.  </p>
