  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">January 20, 2021</h5> 

    <p>Part of the role of being the SoCS school rep is representing student views to a wide variety of academic staff and leadership in the school and university in general. One of the most important meetings of the month is the review with <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/61f58016-2a4e-4e23-b1f7-454af8ba3946" target="_blank">Dr Salah Al-Majeed</a>, Acting Head for the School of Computer Science. This meeting forms a key part of the months calender. I use this meeting to present feedback to help guide what the school works on in the future, i.e. changes that can be made to the following Semester or even 1-2 years out. As a note, urgent day to day items I rely on <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/daa59075-c37c-4a18-a529-ead1acfcf512" target="_blank">Dr Chris Headleand</a> for support as this can more quickly get actions implemented.</p>

    <p>These discussions are always based on comments and feedback that students provide, so it is always important to try and get as much representation as possible for these reviews. I rely on the course reps to help with this element and to help provide a wide perspective across each of the years.</p>  

    <p>As well as voicing any concerns with general items so that Salah is always upto date with the student view (note: all feedback from the anonymous forms are used here even if not detailed on the feedback page of the website), the real aim of the meeting is to try and be proactive and remove any possible future concerns so that they don't grow into problems. We discuss student participation across modules, how lecturers or demonstrators are going to be used to improve student experience, what new modules are being developed or how the school will look and change over the next year or two.</p>

    <p>Two items in our discussion keep popping up as concerns and one item regarding Year 3 options modules. The first item is the use of the pooled sessions and how the students can maximize this time with the lecturer and peers. The second item is how demonstrators are being leveraged and what is the best way to leverage this resource within lectures, workshops as well as the Demonstrator Teams site. Third, having the ability to choose from the full range of optional modules in year 3 across both Semester A and B, especially as we know think of online learning approaches is important to ensure that all students get the learning pathways that they want.</p>

    <p><b>Item 1 </b>- It is very clear from feedback that the lecture experience is not as engaging as the face to face experience. The social element is just not there. The chat function in Teams is tricky to follow as well as trying to ask questions or work/converse in a natural way that supports ideas and key moments of learning. A suggestion on how to improve this was to leverage the demonstrators to either join in and act as moderators/question answerers in the lecture chats and to also hold skills seminars that students could join in on that would compliment the workshops and lecture materials. These would be live sessions and allow people a more flexible and informal way to engage and chat about the topics. The demonstrator Teams site would still be there but rather than 2 demonstrators available at any one time (between 09:00 - 17:00 weekdays), there would be 1 person with the other helping on these wider support items.</p>

    <p><b>Item 2 </b>- The pooled sessions provide a wide opportunity for students to leverage hardware, peer interactions as well interaction with the lecturers leading the sessions. However, not all students have been able to find these sessions useful nor find them a valuable element of the week. From feedback, this is not down to the concept itself but to how the groups have been arranged and what materials are covered in them as well as the ability for the lecturer to support across a wide range of subjects. With this in mind I have requested that students be able to either book onto different sessions (such as how pooled session worked for 2 weeks prior to Christmas break) or, for Year 2 only, have their TSE team members be part of the same pooled group session. This is key when discussing reflections and presenting feedback as well as creating final presentation material. Additionally, this will allow a meeting space for all TSE project team members to come together as they close out the project in Semester B as well as being able to at least have some experience of working Face to Face with your project team. </p>

    <p><b>Item 3 </b>- A key part of 2nd Year Semester B (circa April time) is choosing your optional Modules for Year 3. Historically, students can pick 2 optional modules but, critically, it is 1 option module per Semester. That is fine unless you want to take 2 modules that are only being taught in the same semester (i.e. Semester A). For instance, it is not possible to take both Cloud Computing and Image Analyses, or Autonomous Mobile Robotics and Cross Platform Development. I have asked for the school to consider ways to allow students to take whatever options they like no matter the constraints on Semester periods. As the offering continues to grow of these modules it is important to find more flexibility ways to allow students to take them. With the current on line learning paradigm it seems that this is the right time to try and do this.</p>

    <p>I hope that the school will provide feedback on these request as well as other requests made through the year. I am keen to always ensure that your voices are being heard so if you see anything at all that you wish to be raised please let me know. These meetings with Salah are a great place to try and provide insight into how students experience their learning and also allows opportunity to change this to ensure the students have the best experience possible.</p>
