  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">January 13, 2020</h5> 

    <p>The VP of Education, Georgia Petts <a href="https://lincolnsu.com/change-and-represent/leaders-and-officers" target="_blank">Georgia Petts</a>, called an emergency Senior Rep Group (SRG) meeting to support questions that had been asked over the Christmas break relating to Covid and associated student support requests. As the SoCS School Rep I am invited to these meetings to present feedback, offer reflection and present the SoCS student perspective. </p>  

    <p>These meetings are always very useful to attend. This meeting was pulled forward form the 21st Jan to the 13th Jan so that students reps could get together and present feedback, so that Georgia could then use this in a following day's meeting with the University leadership team. The key points of the meeting are presented below and the main body of discussion was around Safety Net Marks and what is being done in the 2021 academic year to support students through this mechanism. As we know SNM are not in place for this year but a safety net system is, such as unlimited retakes of modules etc. These 2 items should not be confused.</p>

    <p>However the SU is pushing at every available opportunity to urge the University to consider how Safety Net Marks could be implemented in this academic year due to the continuing effects of Covid. As an example other universities, such as Leeds Becket, <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/leeds/2021/01/06/leeds-beckett-becomes-first-uk-uni-to-introduce-safety-net-policy-53416" target="_blank">are implementing their own SNM policies for this academic year</a>, as well as supporting the student body with a safety net system. The issued meeting minutes of the meeting with Georgia are below are cover a range of topics:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>I am still meeting regularly with Liz Mossop, Deputy Vice Chancellor, and will keep you up to date with any other information when I have it</li>

        <li>Safety Nets - There is no Safety Net Mark for any students for the academic year 2020/21 as of yet, there is however a suite of support you can find at the link in the fourth point. I am continuing to work towards more support for students to make we are passing on the concerns and questions that you have all shared. I will keep you updated on this topic, look out for the video with Liz Mossop and myself that will clarify the situation at the moment around safety net queries and the support on offer</li>

        <li>There may be some conflicting information out there, where this is the case, please go with the central communications from the University, but also, please let me know about these</li>

        <li>There have been some changes to Regulations and support available to students recently, and there might be more changes to come. You can see more about the changes here: <a href="https://studentservices.lincoln.ac.uk/life-at-university/continued-support-during-covid19/" target="_blank">https://studentservices.lincoln.ac.uk/life-at-university/continued-support-during-covid19/</a>. Please share this link with anyone that is unsure of the changes</li>

        <li>Conduct on campus - You are all doing a great job at signposting students and keeping me up to date with issues. I am sure you are all already doing this, but if I can ask you for one more thing, if and when you are on campus, please make sure you are following any guidance and restrictions, hopefully all students will follow your lead</li>

        <li>Access to testing - If your course requires you to be on campus, you can get a test, and are encouraged to do so before attending any face to face sessions or using services like the library, but it is not compulsory. The more people that get tested, the more we can control infections on campus, but not having a test will not prevent you from coming back to campus. If your course does not require you to be on campus, you cannot currently access the asymptomatic testing, and can only get a test if you have symptoms, but I know some of you would prefer to be on campus or back at your Uni address as it is easier to study. This is to make sure there is enough capacity for testing for those that have to be on campus</li>

        <li>Coursemate - Lots more submissions are coming through at the moment, please make sure you are updating and completing any that you have assigned to you. You will be emailed when new submissions are assigned to you</li>

      </ol>
