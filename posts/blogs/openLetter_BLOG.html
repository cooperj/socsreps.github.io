  <h5 style="color:grey">September 28, 2020</h5> 

  <p>Today I have written an open letter to DVC Prof Liz Mossop, PVC Prof Libby John, Dr Andy Evenden and Dr Salah Al-Majeed regarding clarity on Teaching and Learning Online and the choices students have to attend face to face workshops/seminars. I have written this letter to make it clear to all students that these questions are being asked. As your school rep, it would be remiss of me not to raise these points on your behalf and to ensure you are as informed as possible.</p>

   <br>
  <p>----------------------------------<br>
  <p><b>Response received on 29th September at 15:11</b></p>

  <p>Dear Garry</p>

  <p>Thank you for your message and my apologies for the slight delay in my response.</p>
  
  <p>Firstly I am sorry that you feel our communications have not been clear – we have tried our best to ensure everyone understands how we are managing the new academic year and what their experience will be like, but I recognise that this may have fallen short in certain areas, particularly as guidance and the situation have changed. I would always advise students with specific questions about their teaching to contact the School and Programme team in the first instance – but we will also be issuing an all student communication later this afternoon to hopefully provide some reassurance around our plans. This email will give you early sight of some of this communication.</p>
  
  <p>As I know you are aware, in line with Government advice we have made detailed plans for a return to campus in October with teaching delivered in a blended way. The exact amounts of how much is delivered face to face and online does vary between programmes and Salah and Chris will be able to give you further information on this in relation to SoCS. It is important to remember that your university experience is more than your teaching and learning and all services on campus such as the Library and Careers service, as well as the SU, have gone through the same process of ensuring their facilities and activities are in line with Government guidance and are delivered in a blended approach.</p>
 
  <p>Students are allowed to travel to their place of study to either live on campus, in the local community or commute on a daily basis, of course adhering to any exceptions according to self-isolation requirements. We are, of course, very aware that there are significant uncertainties for all of us across the country over the next few months as the Government seeks to control the virus and it may be that additional control measures need to be taken either locally or nationally.</p>
 
  <p>We have emphasised throughout our communications that we have to be prepared to move between different modes of online and face-to-face delivery where that is necessary based on public health advice. Our teaching and student support teams have detailed plans in place should this be required by a change in national or local policy, including providing activities and support for our students however they are required to study. For as long as the country is contending with the virus pandemic, we are aware there may need to be intermittent interruptions to our activities, but we are expected by Government to (and we would want to) restore our blended face-to-face and online learning approach as soon as possible, aligned of course with information and guidance from our local Public Health experts.</p>

  <p>We recognise that students need to take account of their own circumstances and that all situations are different, which means that some students may be more concerned about their return to campus. We have been speaking to many students about these issues and we will be making specific adjustments, as per our normal processes, in order to continue to support their learning. I would therefore encourage you to direct any students with these concerns to speak to their Personal Tutor or another member of staff and the Student Support Centre so that we can give further advice.</p>

  <p>You will be interested to hear that we have already been successfully teaching several hundred students on campus over the last three weeks where programmes needed to start early. This has allowed us to learn from these experiences and has been extremely beneficial for all concerned, reconfirming to us the importance of face to face interactions and that it is possible to do this in a Covid-safe manner.</p>
  
  <p>I hope this helps to confirm our expectations around the new academic year. As I say, there will be an all student communication going out later this afternoon which will repeat this information and contain the same advice for students who may be concerned about their individual circumstances.</p>

  <p>I look forward to working with you over the coming year – I know I speak for all of us when I say we cannot wait to have our students back. Georgia and I have discussed holding a further senior rep meeting once teaching begins and I know I would find this very helpful, so it would be great to ensure this happens. Your input at the last one was fantastic.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your hard work supporting your fellow students – it is much appreciated.</p>

  <p>Best wishes</p>

  <p>Liz</p>

  <p>Dear Liz, Libby, Andy and Salah,
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Ref: OPEN LETTER - Online Learning & Student Requirements To Be on Campus</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  First, I would like to thank you all for your heroic efforts over the last 6 months tacking the constantly changing and evolving situation around Covid-19 and mitigating the impact on students and the university community as a whole. I have witnessed first-hand the work that has been put into ensuring that students were impacted as little as possible and any that were, were treated compassionately and fairly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend I have read (The Times, Saturday and Sunday editions), with alert the constantly growing number of lockdowns and isolation requirements for students across UK campuses. I am sure you have also seen these news bulletins. In almost every account that I have read students have assumed they have had to attended campuses to take part fully in their lectures, even if, when a lockdown occurred they would only be able to access resources online. A direct quote from a student is “We were told we would be studying via a hybrid system where some of our course would be online and some in person, which is why we came up to Glasgow under the assumption we had to be there”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assumption of having to be on Campus to fulfil the course is what I am writing about to you today and is something that I have previously written about several times to the The School of Computer Science and the Lincoln SU VP Education.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University has done a very poor job on a school by school level to fully communicate if it is a mandatory requirement whether students have to attend campus or not to complete their respective courses.  It is know that teaching and learning will be ‘agile’ and ‘blended’ but what hasn’t been shown as agile by the university is where the students will live, just the course delivery mechanism to those students. The focus seems to have been all about getting every single student back to campus.
  <br>
  <br>
  I deeply request that the University make it absolutely clear that if students wish to complete their courses off campus and never physically attend campus then that is either an option or not. This clarity should be taken in mind that the University of Lincoln is almost guaranteed to have local lockdowns and isolation cases across campus which would in any fact force students to take their course online – hence, it is clearly possible that courses can be taken in this way, especially for schools such as the School of Computer Science.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not making this as clear as possible to students not only puts many people at a disadvantage but also forces vulnerable and anxious students to relocate back to the area when they may have been better staying at home, especially with spiking Covid-19 amongst younger people. This not only costs thousands of pounds in fees for students but also forces now paradigms due to bubbles and living arrangements, while also putting an extra burden on the associated lecturers.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is still time. Many students have not yet arrived on campus. Please can it be made absolutely clear as quickly as possible if it is a mandatory requirement to physically be on campus and attend face to face workshops/lectures/seminars and if a student chooses not to attend these face to face elements that they will not be penalised.  
  <br>
  <br>
  Note: I will be sharing this email as an open letter and will publish this to the socsreps.github.io website to show that this question has been asked. I will also publish any responses as it is key that students see this conversation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sincerely,
  <br>
  <br>
  Garry
