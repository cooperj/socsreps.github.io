    <p>The <a href="https://www.thestudentsurvey.com" target="_blank">National Student Survey</a> is now here! This is a key moment in all final year graduates calenders as it allows you to reflect across your whole set of experiences at the university to support upcoming students and their university decisions. The survey runs between the 6th Jan and the 30th April with the University of Lincoln starting their NSS activities on the 28th February. All universities can choose when to start their NSS activities and Lincoln has chosen to start a little later than most to ensure that everyone can be embedded in Semester B without worrying about completing this as well.</p>

    <p>Every university puts a lot of effort into supporting students and trying to make sure that every student completes this survey. You would normally see lots of on campus activities and communications, but due to Covid this year will be slightly different, but will have the same dedicated focus!</p>

    <p>As a 3rd year student myself I look forward to completing the survey, but one thing I know will will be doing is making sure I reflect across the whole 3 years of my course. I know I want to make sure that all the great things such as extra-curricular certifications, UROS, one-to-one personal tutoring, off campus activities and trips, mentoring and all the other great things the school has provided and allowed me to do is reflected. I hope that when you fill in your surveyed you also do the same!</p>

    <p>You will over the coming days and weeks see more emails on the National Student Survey but if you ever need any support please contact any of the reps who would be very happy to help point you in the right direction. For those that want to know more please see the great video made by the Office for Students below on what the NSS is and what it means. </p>

    <p>The link to the Survey is <a href="https://nss.ipsosinteractive.com/mrIWeb/mrIWeb.dll" target="_blank">here</a></p>
