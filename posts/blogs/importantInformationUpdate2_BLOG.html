  <h3>Proposal to merge the School of Engineering and School of Computer Science - Update 2</h3>

  <p>On Friday 23rd April I was invited to a meeting to discuss the proposed merger of School of Engineering (SoE) and School of Computer Science (SoCS). This meeting took place on the 31st April at 16:00 and was held by <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/ljohn">Prof Libby John</a>, the Pro Vice Chancellor / Head of College of Science. Participants consisted of <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/f59d7617-69ae-4fca-a926-6c82600cff9b">Dr Andy Evenden</a>, the College Director of Education and Students, <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/61f58016-2a4e-4e23-b1f7-454af8ba3946">Dr Salah Al-Majeed</a>, the Acting Head of School of Computer Science, <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/f469ff35-05db-4ffe-baf1-dd8d67cd9fc2">Dr Ahmed Elseragy</a>, the Acting Head of School of Engineering and Patrick J Carty, the SoE SU School rep. I was invited in my capacity as SoCS SU School Rep.</p> 

  <p>Both Patrick and I were invited to this meeting to be presented with the latest information with regards to the SoE and SoCS merger, and have the opportunity to ask questions. This information had earlier been shared to both the SoE and SoCS school staff.</p>

  <p>The aim of this meeting was to provide assurances and to clarify the goals of the proposed merger along with strengths, challenges, ideas on the way forward, and importantly, what the merger is not about (remove any misconceptions). The following blog is a culmination of my notes of this meeting.</p>

  <h3>The Meeting</h3>

  <p>The meeting consisted of four main slides (a fifth slide was a summary SWOT analysis) that detailed the current state of the project. Firstly, it was made clear that this proposed merger is definitively happening. The merger between the schools is wished to progress as quickly as possible but it was assured that every opportunity for student engagement would be available. I personally found it disappointing that students were not engaged as to how they felt about a merger but also had the impression that this decision had been made some time ago by higher levels in the University. I feel this was a  missed opportunity and even indirectly asking for feedback from past joint SoE and SoCS project participants could have helped inform the high level shape of the merge.</p>

  <p><b>What this merger is not about:</b></p>

  <p>However, what was made clear was that there are many details that have not been worked through. This is so that active engagement from all involved (students, staff etc) can be used to help shape the merger itself. This was very positive to hear. As a note, the slides were presented in a different order to this blog but I will start with what the merger is <b>NOT</b> about:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixing something (there is nothing broken)</li>
    <li>Saving money</li>
    <li>Putting any jobs at risk or demoting anyone</li>
    <li>Removing or taking facilities away from either of the schools</li>
    <li>Changing the way current students are supported</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These assurances given by the Head of the College of Science were very well received and covered the request that  <a href="https://socsreps.github.io/posts/blogs/importantInformationUpdate1_BLOG.html">had been sent previously</a> to these discussions requesting further assurances.</p>

  <p>The main emphasis on these points was that the schools are not broken, but they are also not in the best positions today to leverage what industry and students will be expecting of the schools looking forwards.</p>

  <p><b>The Opportunities:</b></p>

  <p>The opportunities that the merger offered were also presented. The focus of these opportunities was to ensure that students in five years time (say) would see an institution that was ready and able to address challenges that were themselves five years into the future. This was emphasized to be more interdisciplinary needs. For example, many students in the SoE would greatly benefit from Python and coding skills which are not currently one of their taught modules for instance. The presented highlights of these opportunities are noted below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Research and interdisciplinary synergies</li>
    <li>Working with industry to tackle the interdisciplinary challenges they have</li>
    <li>Teaching synergies such as module sharing or projects</li>
    <li>Improved use of shared resource such as space and physical infrastructure (i.e. Siemens MindSphere lab for IoT)</li>
    <li>Improved focus of support staff and academics</li>
    <li>Improved sharing of best practice in research and teaching. Management and administration</li>
    <li>A wider and improved suite of opportunities for students</li>
    <li>Improved branding for the schools with improved marketing and outreach opportunities (student diversity and industry contracts)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>On a personal note, I really dislike the word 'synergies'. In my view this term has negative connotations when used in relation to mergers. I believe it doesn't mean anything negative here, but as students we need to make sure we know exactly what every term really means when presented to us.</i></p>

  <p>Many of these opportunities have not yet been quantified. Some may wonder why two schools that sit side by side and share the same entrance and communal spaces have such a gap in how they work together. From personal experience in industry, it is surprising how little two departments can communicate even though they are only a few meters away. This can be down to many things but could be summed up by having two agendas, two cultures that have grown individually over a period of time, but also recognizing the fact that the SoE and SoCS have only been physically adjacent since 2017/18, when SoCS was officially relocated to the INB from what was the Media, Humanities and Technology (MHT) Building, now known as the Alfred Tennyson Building. In many ways, this structural merger is a culmination of that physical one.</p>

  <p>A key question asked here is how we students hold the leadership team to account on delivering on these above promises, and how each one of these commitments is measured, and what those measures of success are. What does 'better' really mean, how may more  'opportunities' should students expect to see, what 'synergies' should students except to be part of and so on. Additionally, as stake holders we should always challenge on why these could not be achieved as schools in their own right.</p>

  <p><b>The Challenges:</b></p>

  <p>As with all change, it can be difficult. Even crossing your arms in a different way can feel awkward. The school discussed several key challenges (not a exhaustive list) that they initially see. This is because many change processes start as they mean to go on and making sure you bring the stakeholders along the journey with you gives a much better likelihood of successfully delivering all of the highlighted opportunities.</p> 

  <p>Of each of the slides this one was the least comprehensive. This caused me a little concern as identifying but also being fully open about the risks and challenges, and having mitigating actions strengthens the chance of success, and for students to benefit from the merger.</p>

  <p>As stakeholders we should always make sure that the challenges with the merger are clear, visible and openly shared. In my experience it is when these challenges don't get full attention alongside the opportunities that the benefits of a merge begin to be diluted or even silently canceled (i.e. this could be because project funds have run out or resources redeployed to tackle an unexpected problem). These challenges discussed in the meeting are highlighted below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Managing communication and expectations</li>
    <li>Losing the identity and brand of each schools</li>
    <li>External accrediting bodies and managing their view</li>
    <li>Merging two cultures</li>
    <li>There is no perfect time. This is only one project - Covid, wider University programmes etc all need attention. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Communication and expectation management is something as students we are familiar with. CRGs and assignment briefs are one such item that we each interpret in our own way. With such a large project such as a merger and many stakeholders each with their own priorities there will be some misunderstanding at some time. I ask students to keep asking questions but also recoginise that making sure everyone is on the same page at all times is very difficult.</p>

  <p>We each know that SoCS has its own special community and culture. Many of the lecturers have earned their PhDs at the school, several lecturers have started their undergraduate degrees in the school. Student societies, gamejams, hackathons and shared experiences [Marmalade] - all make us one community. This is important and is a conscious element on the minds of the CoS leadership team. Cultures can clash in the most unexpected ways, but both SoE and SoCS have recently had new Acting Heads of school and it is in their remit to manage this aspect of the merge. As students and custodians of the community it is up to us to tell them if we feel it it is diluted or being lost. Please be vocal and forward on this.</p>

  <p><b>The Way Forward</b></p>

  <p>The final slide presented described the way forward. As noted before, these elements are not fully developed but the highlights were discussed. What was reassuring was that students were a key component of every item. This was made very clear through the whole meeting. The key highlights for what the college sees as the way forward are below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Involving everyone and making sure they know their voice is being heard</li>
    <li>Working groups to develop the shape and vision for the joint schools</li>
    <li>Openness and transparency</li>
    <li>Working with current and new external stakeholders and making sure that standards are maintained</li>
    <li>Using best practice and learning from  what other universities have done</li>
    <li>Identifying the most optimal structure and what this will look like in the near and mid term (1 x super department or 2 x separate departments or something else etc)</li>
    <li>Making sure students do not feel any negative consequences of the merger</li>
    <li>Conversations with students must be positive</li>
    <li>What the new school will be called</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of the above is only achievable if students take an active interest, engage and hold the schools accountable. Although this is the very start of the discussion if you feel that there is a lack of information then please voice this. I personally hope that communication events such as Town Halls, Personal Tutor sessions, dedicated Question and Answers sessions are all utilized.</p>

  <p>From the meeting I however got the impression that each of the above points was shown in full honesty and transparency. I do believe that there is a real interest to include students and make sure that they have a say in shaping the school for the next generation of students to make sure they have the skills needed to tackle the problems that they are faced with.</p>

  <p>An interesting aspect that come up was what the new name of the school would be. This has not been decided so please feel free to share your thoughts. It may seem trivial but this is the place that you will remember doing your studies and having some of the best and most challenging times of your life so will stay with you forever.</p>

  <p><b>Questions I asked on your behalf:</b></p>

  <p>At the end of the presentation, Patrick and I were offered the chance to ask questions and share our initial thoughts. As a your school rep I hold a neutral view until the student body asks me to represent one. My past actions on this matter have been to try and give you as much information about your school as possible, as quickly as possible. On this basis I asked six questions (not pre-planned or in any order) and the answers are below. <i>Note: I have paraphrased from memory so these are my words and not exact responses.</i></p>

   <ul style="list-style-type:none">

    <li><b>Q.</b> How will it be assured that neither school will be diluted?</li>
    <li><i><b>A.</b> This is opportunity for both schools to grow and there is no intention to prioritise any school over the other.</i></li><br>

    <li><b>Q.</b>Can you explain what the merger will give that we would not have had if we did not merge, i.e. what is the size of gap or opportunity that is being realised by merging?</li>
    <li><i><b>A.</b> This merger is about leveraging interdisciplinary opportunities that are not current available. Industry feedback shows that a closer working relationship will provide more opportunities. For instance, new industry partners will be possible. </i></li><br>

    <li><b>Q.</b>Siemens are very visible in the SoE, SoCS has very limited if any visible presence in INB, how do we stop SoCS becoming just a part of a SoE?</li>
    <li><i><b>A.</b> Yes, identify is important and SoCS doesn't have enough visibility in the INB. That is something we need to change. Names and titles are seen to be important but this isn't about one school taking over another.</i></li><br>

    <li><b>Q.</b>What is the timeline for the merge and what are the next steps. Will students be involved over the next months?</li>
    <li><i><b>A.</b> As soon as possible. Interaction will begin in weeks not months and students may see some sign of the merger for the start of the 21/22 academic year (October 2021).</i></li><br>

    <li><b>Q.</b>These projects always start out with lofty goals but many times they end up only achieving a small part. How can the commitments made be assured?</li>
    <li><i><b>A.</b> We now have Acting Heads of schools for both SoE and SoCS. Further recruitment etc takes time but the acting heads are leading the process at school level and will be ensuring the commitments are implemented.</i></li><br>

    <li><b>Q.</b>How will you ensure students are meaningfully involved and who will be leading this to ensure they are?</li>
    <li><i><b>A.</b> The first meeting in the SoE takes place next week with the reps and the SoCS has its first meeting with the school cohort on the 4th May. We will use working groups and invite students to take part. The acting heads of school will be leading these engagement processes.</i></li><br>

  </ul>

  <p>Several more questions popped into my head after the meeting, such as how do students hold the schools accountable, is there a way for students to see if the merger is on track or off track to commitments, if something isn't working how do students communicate this, if students have an idea how do they share that with the school and so on.</p>

  <p>As well as focusing on the Colleges role, I also ask students to find our how you can help the merger (now that it is confirmed) be as strong as it can be. Ask how you can help, find out where you can contribute, when feedback is requested give as much as you can. Make sure your concerns are always known but also make sure that the things that you think are going well are equally as known.</i></p>

  <p><b>How to be involved:</b></p>

  <p>It is up to every student to be an active participant of this merger. The schools are actively seeking feedback on your thoughts, comments and concerns. But they are also looking for feedback on what opportunities students would like to see - group projects, extra industry experiences, wider suite of modules, alternative degree pathways and so on. This feedback has the widest potential for students to have a direct impact and to shape the future of the school.</p>

  <p>Please do not be silent on giving any of your thoughts. If you want to do this anonymously the reps provide an <b><a href="../../feedback.html">anonymous feedback form</a></b> that can be used and we will happily share this on your behalf. A link to this post will also be made in the SoCS Common Room on Teams that we all have access to where comments can also be made. I also actively encourage all students to feel confident in <b>openly sharing your ideas</b> through email or with your personal tutor.</p>

  <p><b>What's next:</b></p>

  <p>Each school will now be actively and publicly asking for student engagement and I ask that all students look out for this. This may take many forms such as focus groups, panels and feedback reviews. Dr Salah Al-Majeed is leading this for the SoCS. The best way to ensure that you have your views heard is by participating in these calls for engagement.</p>

  <p>The very first meeting is a school wide Teams meeting where we will all be able to ask Dr Salah Al-Majeed what his aspirations are for the school, how he sees the development of a joint school over the next five years, what his measures of success will be, and how as students, we can hold the college accountable for the commitments being made. As well as many other questions. You have each been invited to this <b>(Tuesday 4th May 2021 at 14:00)</b>. Please try to make it! </p>

  <p><b>Message from your School Rep:</b></p>

  <p>I ask all students to get engaged in this process in anyway you can. Lincoln was the birth place of Boolean logic, a principle foundation of computing. You each walk everyday the same streets where Boole would have developed the concepts that many of the foundations of our studies are based upon. As custodians of this legacy we have a duty to make sure that we leave our School of Computer Science stronger than when we found it at the start of our studies. This is not just to honour the legacy of the past that stretches from Boole all the way to present day, but to make sure those students that follow us do so in a way that the community we are all now and will always be part of, gets stronger and stronger.</p>
