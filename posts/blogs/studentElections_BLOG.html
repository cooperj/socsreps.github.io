    <p>Student rep elections are upon us! They can be difficult to understand, but all you really need to know is that they take place in March and October. The March elections are for the volunteer officers, such as the school rep, and course reps for those that will be entering Year 2 and 3. The October elections are for the new 1st years and a second chance for anyone that wants to become a volunteer rep for Year 2 and 3. For full details see the <a href="https://lincolnsu.com/nominate" target="_blank">Lincoln SU nominations</a> website.</p>

    <p>The process takes place in two sequential parts - <b>Nominations</b> and <b>Voting</b>:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Nominations: 1st - 12th March</b> - This is where a student can nominate themselves to a role. This requires that a student complet the nomination process and put a few words together to create a very high level manifesto. Some roles have limited numbers, such as there is only 1 x School Rep per School. However, roles such as course reps can have more open positions. <mark>Nominations open on the 1st March at 09:00 and close on the 12th March at 14:00.</mark></li>

      <li><b>Voting: 15th - 19th March </b> - Once nominations have closed then the voting process can begin. This is where students are invited to nominate for their preferred candidate for each of the role. <mark>Voting opens on the 15th March at 20:00 and close on the 19th March at 14:00.</mark></li>
    </ol> 

    <p><b>Please spend just 2 minutes and <a href="https://lincolnsu.com/elections" target="_blank">Vote Here</a>!</b></p>
