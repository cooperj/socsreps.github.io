    <p>One of the privileges of being the SoCS School Rep is that you have the opportunity to engage with the senior leadership team of the College of Science. Today I had the opportunity to meet with <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/07362c5c-611e-418e-93d9-4edfdb94a622">Prof Libby John</a> who is the Pro Vice Chancellor / Head of College of Science and also <a href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/f59d7617-69ae-4fca-a926-6c82600cff9b">Dr Andy Evenden</a> who is the College Director of Education and Students. This meeting was the first of our monthly School Rep Group meetings within the College of Sciences (School of Pharmacy, geography, Chemistry, Life Sciences etc). These meetings are hosted by Libby and Andy and we (as School Reps) represent <b>your voice</b> to this team. 
    </p>

    <p>From the very start of the meeting their authenticity and their enthusiasm shone through. Their absolute focus on making the student experience as best as it can possibly be, but also, making sure that every student, no matter background, sexuality, ethnicity, gender or religion has the best opportunity to access the best resources to maximize every single ounce of their potential, was clearly evident. It is very clear, they care about every single student, a lot! </p>

    <p>This first meeting was mainly about introducing ourselves as School Reps to Libby and Andy and giving a brief overview of what our focus was for the upcoming year. We discussed Women in Science, and the vast opportunities to do much more on demonstrating the great work that is ongoing on this front in the CoS. We discussed the idea of Respect Officers and the opportunity of implementing this role to enhance support and awareness for all students. We also discussed the importance of Peer Mentoring as well as new ideas of communicating to students and the CoS cohort as a whole. Importantly, we also discussed the impact on Covid-19 on the 20/21 academic year but also what great new things are being planned to make it the most rewarding year yet.</p>

    <p>The meeting overall lasted around 45 minutes (via Teams), and although these discussion were very high level and really just an introduction to future campaign opportunities and activities available for the schools, it was really great to see how each of the School Reps was carefully listened to, was asked questions of, and also encouraged to go as far as possible.</p>

    <p>Our next meeting with Libby and Andy will probably be more formal with a clearer understanding of student concerns as the new Semester starts, however, I come away knowing that Libby and Andy hold a deep seated commitment to improving not only the student experience, but also presented a laser focus on ensuring the courses as a whole are rigorous, of high value and character building. I really look forward to our next meeting (mid October) and updating you all on the output of this.</p>

    <p><i>Now to my bit ...</i> the only reason I, as your School Rep, participates in these meetings is so that you and your voice is represented and heard. Make sure you use this forum. If you are not having the experience you want then please reach out and let us know. This can be done through the <b><a href="../../index.html#about">Contact Us</a></b> section or <b><a href="../../feedback.html">Feedback Form</a></b>. No concern or idea is too small.  </p>
